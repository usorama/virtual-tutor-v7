## 📊 Results by Severity

## 💡 Recovery Improvement Recommendations

### 🔧 Error Handling Improvements

- Add proper error boundaries in React components
- Improve API error response handling
- Add fallback mechanisms for critical features

### 🎨 Graceful Degradation Improvements
- Maintain basic page functionality during errors
- Implement progressive enhancement strategies
- Provide alternative UI paths when features fail
- Ensure core navigation remains accessible

### 👥 User Experience Improvements
- Replace technical error messages with user-friendly alternatives
- Provide context about what went wrong
- Offer guidance on what users can do next

## ✅ Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Fail Fast, Recover Gracefully**: Detect errors early but provide smooth fallbacks
2. **User-Centric Messages**: Error messages should be helpful to users, not developers
3. **Multiple Recovery Paths**: Always provide users with options to recover
4. **Preserve User Data**: Don't lose user input during error states
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality should work even when advanced features fail
6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Track errors in production for continuous improvement
