## Risk Analysis Evidence

### High-Risk Stories Identified

#### 1. ARCH-004: Dependency Injection Setup
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Duration**: 12 hours (longest single story)
- **Critical Path**: Yes (blocks final integration)
- **Dependencies**: ARCH-002 + ARCH-003 (must wait 18 hours)
- **Mitigation Recommended**: Split into 2 stories (DI Container + DI Injector)
- **Allocation**: Senior architect required

#### 2. SEC-003: CSRF Protection for All API Routes
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Duration**: 6 hours
- **File Impact**: Touches `src/app/api/**/*.ts` (all routes)
- **Conflict Risk**: High (merge conflicts with other API changes)
- **Mitigation Recommended**: Complete early in Wave 1, middleware-based approach
- **Allocation**: Security specialist with API expertise

#### 3. ARCH-003: Repository Pattern Implementation
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Duration**: 10 hours
- **Critical Path**: Yes (blocks ARCH-004)
- **Complexity**: High (architectural foundation)
- **Mitigation Recommended**: Clear interface definition upfront, incremental validation
- **Allocation**: Senior architect

### File Conflict Hotspots Documented

| Hotspot | Files | Stories | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|---------|-------|---------|------------|------------|
| TS Utility Types | `src/lib/types/utility-types.ts` | TS-011, TS-015, TS-017 | MEDIUM | Sequential execution |
| ARCH Services | `src/services/**/*.ts`, `src/repositories/**/*.ts` | ARCH-002, ARCH-003, ARCH-004 | HIGH | Critical path sequencing |
| ERR Boundaries | `src/components/errors/ErrorBoundary.tsx` | ERR-008, ERR-009 | LOW | Clear component separation |

## Optimization Opportunities Identified

### 1. Wave 1 Sub-Waving (Security Stories)
**Analysis**: 12 SEC stories starting simultaneously could strain CI/CD
**Recommendation**: Stagger into 4 sub-waves (SEC-GROUP-A through D)
**Trade-off**: +4 hours duration, but 50% less CI/CD strain
**Impact**: Lower risk, smoother execution, better code review

### 2. Critical Path Story Splitting (ARCH-004)
**Analysis**: 12-hour story is single point of failure
**Recommendation**: Split into ARCH-004A (DI Container, 6h) + ARCH-004B (DI Injector, 6h)
**Trade-off**: More coordination overhead
**Impact**: Enables some parallelization, reduces single-story risk by 50%

### 3. Early Testing Integration (TEST-005, TEST-006)
**Analysis**: Performance and load tests can establish baselines
**Recommendation**: Run TEST-005/TEST-006 first in Wave 1
**Trade-off**: None (already in Wave 1)
**Impact**: Early performance baselines for validation

## Agent Allocation Analysis

### Optimal Agent Distribution

| Wave | Optimal Count | Minimum Count | Duration @ Optimal | Duration @ Min | Efficiency |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|
| Wave 1 | 22 | 12 | 86 hours | 95 hours | 100% vs 82% |
| Wave 2 | 6 | 4 | 29 hours | 35 hours | 67% vs 54% |
| Wave 3 | 2 | 2 | 17 hours | 17 hours | 100% vs 100% |
| Wave 4 | 1 | 1 | 10 hours | 10 hours | 100% vs 100% |

**Recommendation**:
- Start with 12 agents (minimum viable)
- Scale to 22 agents if resources available
- Prioritize: Security specialists (12), TypeScript specialists (5), Architects (3), Test specialists (2)
