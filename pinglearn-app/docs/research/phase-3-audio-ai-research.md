# Phase 3 Research: Audio-to-Audio AI Classroom Implementation

**Research Date:** September 19, 2024  
**Research Focus:** Gemini Live API + LiveKit integration for real-time voice conversations  
**Objective:** Re-plan Phase 3 based on audio-to-audio AI capabilities instead of traditional STT/TTS pipeline

---

## Executive Summary

Our research reveals that **Gemini Live API 2.5 Flash + LiveKit** provides a revolutionary audio-to-audio conversation platform that eliminates the need for separate Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) components. This technology enables direct voice conversations between students and AI tutors with near-human latency and emotional understanding.

**Key Finding:** The traditional Phase 3 plan focused on TTS/STT pipeline is obsolete. Modern audio AI enables direct audio-to-audio conversations with superior quality and lower latency.

## Current System Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working (Phase 2 Complete)
- Authentication with Supabase (functional)
- Database schema with 5 tables (profiles, textbooks, chapters, content_chunks, curriculum_data)
- Class selection wizard (Grade ‚Üí Subject ‚Üí Topic flow)
- PDF processing pipeline (built but not used)
- Beautiful responsive UI with shadcn/ui

### ‚ùå Critical Gap Identified
**TEXTBOOK PROCESSING DISCONNECT:**
- Dashboard shows "0 Textbooks Available for study"
- We have actual NCERT Class X Mathematics PDFs in `/text-books/Class X Mathematics/`
- Built PDF processing pipeline but never processed actual textbooks
- Wizard shows all CBSE grades/subjects but only Class X Mathematics is available
- **Result:** Students can't learn because no processed content exists

### üö® Immediate Fix Required
Before Phase 3, we need **Phase 2.5: Content Processing & Alignment**
1. Process existing NCERT Class X Mathematics textbooks
2. Align wizard to only show available content
3. Ensure dashboard reflects processed textbooks
