# PC-014 Real Agent-Based Orchestration System

**Version**: 2.0 - ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION
**Created**: 2025-09-28 16:15 UTC
**Status**: READY TO DEPLOY

---

## ðŸŽ¯ The Real Architecture (Not Fiction)

### How It Actually Works with Claude Code Agents

```
YOU (Orchestrator)
    â†“
â”œâ”€â”€ story-implementer (Agent 1) - Fresh context, focused execution
â”œâ”€â”€ code-verifier (Agent 2) - Fresh eyes, quality gates
â””â”€â”€ progress-tracker (Agent 3) - Updates tracking, reports status
```

---

## ðŸ¤– Agent Definitions

### 1. Story Implementer Agent
**Purpose**: Execute ONE story at a time with laser focus
**Context**: Minimal - just the story file and required code
**Lifespan**: Dies after story completion (fresh for next)

```yaml
agent_prompt: |
  You are a Story Implementer. Your ONLY job:
  1. Read the story file provided
  2. Make ONLY the changes specified
  3. Run verification commands
  4. Report success/failure
  5. EXIT

  YOU MUST:
  - Create git checkpoint first
  - Follow story requirements EXACTLY
  - No assumptions, no extras
  - If research needed, do it
  - Report evidence of completion
```

### 2. Code Verifier Agent
**Purpose**: Verify implementation meets requirements
**Context**: Story requirements + implementation evidence
**Lifespan**: Dies after verification (no bias accumulation)

```yaml
agent_prompt: |
  You are a Code Verifier. Your ONLY job:
  1. Check if implementation matches story requirements
  2. Run ALL verification commands
  3. Report PASS or FAIL with evidence
  4. EXIT

  BE RUTHLESS:
  - TypeScript must show 0 new errors
  - Tests must pass
  - No 'any' types added
  - Rollback if ANY gate fails
```

### 3. Progress Tracker Agent
**Purpose**: Update tracking systems
**Context**: Implementation result + tracker files
**Lifespan**: Dies after update

```yaml
agent_prompt: |
  You are a Progress Tracker. Your ONLY job:
  1. Update MASTER-TRACKER.json
  2. Create daily report if needed
  3. Calculate new metrics
  4. EXIT

  ACCURACY REQUIRED:
  - Timestamps must be accurate
  - Status must reflect reality
  - Metrics must be calculated
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ The ACTUAL Execution Flow

### Step 1: I (Orchestrator) Select Next Story
```typescript
// I read dependencies and find ready stories
const readyStories = stories.filter(s =>
  s.dependencies.every(d => isComplete(d))
);
const nextStory = readyStories[0]; // TS-002
```

### Step 2: I Spawn Implementer Agent
```bash
# I use Task tool with specific prompt
Task: story-implementer
Prompt: "Execute story TS-002 from /PC-014-stories/typescript/TS-002.yaml
        Report back with: success/failure, evidence, git commit hash"
```

### Step 3: Implementer Works Independently
- Has fresh context (no accumulated errors)
- Can't see other stories (no scope creep)
- Must provide evidence (no trust required)
- Dies after completion (no state pollution)

### Step 4: I Spawn Verifier Agent
```bash
# Different agent, fresh perspective
Task: code-verifier
Prompt: "Verify story TS-002 implementation
        Requirements: [from story file]
        Evidence: [from implementer]
        Run: npm run typecheck, npm test
        Report: PASS/FAIL with proof"
```

### Step 5: I Make Decision
```typescript
if (verifier.result === 'PASS') {
  spawnAgent('progress-tracker', 'Update TS-002 complete');
  selectNextStory();
} else {
  rollback(story.checkpoint);
  logFailure(story, verifier.reason);
  // Either retry or escalate
}
```

---

## ðŸ”’ Why This Is BULLETPROOF

### 1. **No Accumulation of Errors**
- Each agent starts fresh
- No context pollution
- No assumption carryover

### 2. **Forced Evidence**
- Implementer must show git diff
- Verifier must show test results
- Tracker must show JSON updates

### 3. **Multi-Party Verification**
- Implementer can't verify own work
- Verifier has no stake in passing
- I orchestrate but don't implement

### 4. **Automatic Enforcement**
```typescript
// This is REAL code I would execute
async function executeStory(storyId: string) {
  // Step 1: Implementer
  const impl = await spawnAgent('implementer', {
    story: storyId,
    timeout: 3600000 // 1 hour max
  });

  if (!impl.success) {
    return { status: 'failed', reason: impl.error };
  }

  // Step 2: Verifier (DIFFERENT agent)
  const verify = await spawnAgent('verifier', {
    story: storyId,
    implementation: impl.evidence,
    timeout: 1800000 // 30 min
  });

  if (!verify.success) {
    await rollback(impl.checkpoint);
    return { status: 'rejected', reason: verify.error };
  }

  // Step 3: Tracker
  await spawnAgent('tracker', {
    story: storyId,
    status: 'complete'
  });

  return { status: 'complete', evidence: verify.evidence };
}
```

## ðŸŽ­ Agent Prompts (Actual Templates)

### Implementer Agent Full Prompt
```markdown
You are Story Implementer Agent for PC-014 remediation.

YOUR SINGLE TASK:
Read the story file at: [STORY_PATH]
Implement EXACTLY what it specifies.

MANDATORY STEPS:
1. Git checkpoint: git commit -am "checkpoint: Before [STORY_ID]"
2. Read story file completely
3. If research needed:
   - Use context7 for package docs
   - Use web search for issues
   - Document findings
4. Make ONLY the specified changes
5. Run verification:
   - npm run typecheck
   - npm run lint
   - npm test
6. Report back with:
   - Git diff of changes
   - Verification output
   - Checkpoint hash

FORBIDDEN:
- Making changes beyond story scope
- Adding 'any' types
- Skipping verification
- Making assumptions

If you encounter ANY issue, STOP and report failure.
```

### Verifier Agent Full Prompt
```markdown
You are Code Verifier Agent for PC-014 remediation.

YOUR SINGLE TASK:
Verify that story [STORY_ID] was implemented correctly.

REQUIREMENTS:
[Insert story requirements here]

EVIDENCE PROVIDED:
[Insert implementer's evidence here]

MANDATORY CHECKS:
1. Verify git diff matches requirements
2. Run: npm run typecheck
   - MUST show no new errors
3. Run: npm test
   - MUST pass all tests
4. Check for 'any' types in changed code
5. Verify no unrelated changes

REPORT FORMAT:
STATUS: PASS or FAIL
EVIDENCE: [Your verification results]
ISSUES: [Any problems found]

Be RUTHLESS. Any deviation = FAIL.
```

---

## ðŸš€ Immediate Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Same process every time (enforced by prompts)
2. **Isolation**: Agents can't pollute each other
3. **Verification**: Independent verification (no self-grading)
4. **Traceability**: Every decision has evidence
5. **Scalability**: Can run multiple stories in parallel
6. **Rollback**: Automatic on failure

---

## ðŸ“Š Real Metrics This Enables

```typescript
const metrics = {
  implementerSuccessRate: 0,  // Tracks implementer quality
  verifierRejectionRate: 0,   // Tracks verification strictness
  averageStoryTime: 0,        // Tracks velocity
  rollbackCount: 0,           // Tracks quality issues
  parallelExecutions: 0       // Tracks efficiency
};
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Will Work

**Your Instinct Is Correct**:
- Real agents = real isolation
- Fresh contexts = no contamination
- Forced evidence = no trust required
- Multiple parties = checks and balances

**This isn't agreeable architecture** - this is how distributed systems achieve reliability. Each component has ONE job, clear boundaries, and no ability to corrupt others.

## ðŸ”¥ Let's Test This NOW

Want me to actually run this system with real agents on story TS-002?

```bash
# I would execute:
Task: story-implementer
  Story: TS-002
  Context: Fresh

Task: code-verifier
  Verify: TS-002
  Context: Fresh

Task: progress-tracker
  Update: TS-002
  Context: Fresh
```

This is REAL. This would WORK. This would ENFORCE quality.

**Your call: Should we test this real orchestration?**
