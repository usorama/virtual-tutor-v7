# PC-015 Quick Reference Card

**Date**: 2025-10-03 | **Status**: ✅ READY FOR UAT

## 🚨 The Problem (One Sentence)

AI teacher always said "Class 10 Math" regardless of what user selected in wizard.

---

## ✅ The Solution (One Sentence)

Dynamic prompts + metadata flow from frontend → Python agent = correct personalization.

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

```
❌ BEFORE                          ✅ AFTER

User selects: Grade 12 Physics    User selects: Grade 12 Physics
AI says: "Class 10 Math teacher"  AI says: "Grade 12 Physics teacher"
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes (3 Main Fixes)

### 1. Python Agent (agent.py)
```python
# BEFORE
HARDCODED_PROMPT = "Class 10 Math tutor"

# AFTER
def create_tutor_prompt(grade, subject, topic):
    return f"You are a {grade} {subject} tutor..."
```

### 2. Metadata Parsing (VoiceSessionManager.ts)
```typescript
// BEFORE
extractGrade() { return 'Grade 10'; }  // BUG!

// AFTER
extractGrade(topic) {
  const match = topic.match(/Grade\s+(\d+)/i);
  return match ? `Grade ${match[1]}` : 'Grade 10';
}
```

### 3. Metadata Flow (Complete Pipeline)
```
Wizard → DB → Classroom → VoiceSessionManager
  → Token Route (NEW: accepts metadata)
  → LiveKit Room (NEW: stores metadata)
  → Python Agent (NEW: reads metadata)
  → Dynamic Greeting ✅
```

## 📊 Test Results

```
TypeScript Errors:    0 / 0      ✅
Automated Tests:      6 / 6      ✅
Integration Points:   8 / 8      ✅
Subjects Supported:   All NCERT  ✅
```

## 🎬 How to Verify (UAT)

1. Login to PingLearn
2. Complete wizard: Select **Grade 12** + **Physics**
3. Go to classroom
4. Start voice session
5. **Listen for greeting**:
   - ✅ Should say: "Grade 12 Physics teacher"
   - ❌ Should NOT say: "Class 10 Mathematics teacher"

## 📁 Full Documentation

| Document | Purpose | Size |
|----------|---------|------|
| `PC-015-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md` | Quick overview | 4KB |
| `PC-015-ROOT-CAUSE-ANALYSIS.md` | Complete analysis | 19KB |
| `PC-015-E2E-VERIFICATION.md` | Integration testing | 11KB |
| `PC-015-show-n-tell-transcription-fix.md` | Implementation spec | 64KB |

**Total**: ~98KB of evidence-based documentation

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Deferred to Future)

1. **Polling inefficiency**: 28 polls/sec (works, but could be optimized)
2. **Race condition**: ~5% chance of first transcript loss (rare)
3. **No streaming animation**: Text appears instantly (not ChatGPT-style)

**Impact**: LOW - Core functionality works, optimization opportunities remain

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If something breaks:
```bash
git reset --hard 2e399b8
npm run dev
```

This rolls back ALL PC-015 changes.

---

## 🎓 Key Lessons

1. **Fix critical path first** (preferences > performance > polish)
2. **Evidence-based analysis prevents duplicate work** (DisplayBuffer already had subscriptions!)
3. **E2E testing catches bugs earlier** (parsing bug found before production)
4. **Multi-agent investigation is faster** (5 agents parallel > 1 agent serial)
