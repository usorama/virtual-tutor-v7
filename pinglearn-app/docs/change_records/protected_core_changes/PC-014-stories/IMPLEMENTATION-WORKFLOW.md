# PC-014 Implementation Workflow - After Approval

**Created**: 2025-09-28T15:30:00Z
**Purpose**: Complete workflow from approval to completion

---

## 🚀 How Implementation Actually Works (Post-Approval)

### Day 0: Initialization (2-4 hours)
```
1. APPROVAL RECEIVED
   ↓
2. Git Checkpoint Created
   git commit -m "checkpoint: PC-014 implementation start"
   ↓
3. Orchestrator Activated
   /orchestrate PC-014 --initialize
   ↓
4. Stories Generated & Validated
   - 53 stories created from 15 issues
   - Dependencies mapped
   - Agents notified
```

---

## 📋 Daily Implementation Cycle

### Morning Standup (9:00 AM)
```bash
/orchestrate morning-standup
```
**Output**:
```
=== PC-014 Day 3 Standup ===
Yesterday: Completed 3 stories (TS-001, TS-002, TS-003)
Today: Targeting 4 stories (TS-004, SEC-001, ERR-001, ARCH-001)
Blockers: None
Velocity: 3.0 stories/day (on track)
Risk: Database schema conflict needs attention
```

### Story Assignment (9:15 AM)
```bash
/orchestrate assign-daily-batch
```
**Process**:
1. Orchestrator checks dependencies
2. Identifies ready stories (dependencies met)
3. Matches to available agents
4. Creates assignments:
```yaml
Assignment-2025-09-29-001:
  story: TS-004
  agent: typescript-specialist
  priority: P1
  dependencies_met: true
  estimated_completion: 11:00 AM
```

### Agent Execution (9:30 AM - 5:00 PM)
Each agent follows this strict protocol:

#### Step 1: Check-In
```bash
Agent: /agent check-in typescript-specialist
Orchestrator: Agent registered. Available stories: TS-004, TS-007
```

#### Step 2: Claim Story
```bash
Agent: /agent claim TS-004
Orchestrator: Story TS-004 locked to typescript-specialist
            Git checkpoint: abc123def
            Timer started: 09:32 AM
```

#### Step 3: Implementation
```bash
# Agent creates checkpoint
git commit -m "checkpoint: Before TS-004 implementation"

# Agent implements changes
- Reads story file (TS-004.yaml)
- Makes required code changes
- Follows implementation steps exactly

# Every 30 minutes
Agent: /agent progress TS-004 --status "60% complete, removing any types from dashboard"
```

#### Step 4: Verification Gate
```bash
# Agent runs mandatory checks
npm run typecheck  # MUST pass
npm run lint       # MUST pass
npm test          # MUST pass

Agent: /agent verify TS-004
Orchestrator: Running verification suite...
              ✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
              ✅ Linting: Passed
              ✅ Tests: All passing
              ✅ Story requirements: Met
```

#### Step 5: Completion
```bash
Agent: /agent complete TS-004
Orchestrator: Story TS-004 marked complete
              Duration: 1.5 hours
              Status: SUCCESS
              Next available: TS-007
```

---

## 🔒 Compliance & Control Mechanisms

### 1. **Mandatory Quality Gates**
Every story MUST pass before marking complete:
```yaml
quality_gates:
  typescript: zero_errors_required
  linting: must_pass
  tests: all_passing
  coverage: no_reduction_allowed
  performance: no_degradation
```

### 2. **Automatic Rollback Triggers**
```bash
if (verification_failed) {
  orchestrator.rollback(story_id);
  orchestrator.reassign(story_id, different_agent);
  orchestrator.notify(stakeholders);
}
```

### 3. **Compliance Checkpoints**
```
Every 2 hours: Compliance scan
- Are we following the plan?
- Any unauthorized changes?
- Protected core still intact?
- Dependencies respected?
```

### 4. **Story Lock Mechanism**
```typescript
// Prevents conflicts
class StoryLock {
  acquire(storyId, agentId) {
    if (this.isLocked(storyId)) {
      throw new Error(`Story ${storyId} already locked`);
    }
    this.locks[storyId] = {
      agent: agentId,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      timeout: 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000  // 4 hour timeout
    };
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy (Continuous Validation)

### Level 1: Story-Level Tests
Each story includes its own tests:
```yaml
# In each story file
test_requirements:
  - Unit tests for changed code
  - Integration tests if applicable
  - No regression in existing tests
```

### Level 2: Daily Regression
```bash
# Runs automatically at 6 PM
/orchestrate regression-test --daily
```
- Full test suite execution
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scan
- TypeScript compilation

### Level 3: Week-End Validation
```bash
# Every Friday
/orchestrate validate --weekly
```
- Complete E2E test suite
- Load testing
- Security penetration testing
- Stakeholder demo preparation

## 🚨 Issue Escalation & Resolution

### Escalation Triggers
1. **Story blocked >4 hours** → Team lead notified
2. **Agent unavailable** → Work redistributed
3. **Verification failures >2** → Story redesigned
4. **Dependencies broken** → Emergency standup

### Resolution Protocol
```
Issue Detected → Orchestrator Analysis → Automated Resolution
                                      ↓ (if fails)
                                   Manual Intervention
                                      ↓
                                   Stakeholder Decision
```
