## Section 4: Safety Protocol

### 4.1 Implementation Safety Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Create git checkpoint before each story implementation
- **MANDATORY**: TypeScript must show 0 errors after each change
- **MANDATORY**: All tests must pass before proceeding to next story
- **MANDATORY**: Security scan after each security-related fix
- **MANDATORY**: Manual verification of each fix in isolated environment

### 4.2 Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Individual story rollback
git reset --hard [story-checkpoint-hash]

# Complete remediation rollback
git reset --hard [pc-014-checkpoint-hash]

# Emergency production rollback
git checkout phase-3-stabilization-uat
git reset --hard [last-known-good-commit]
```

### 4.3 Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Must maintain >90% coverage for modified code
- **Integration Tests**: All protected core interactions must be tested
- **Security Tests**: Penetration testing for security fixes
- **Performance Tests**: No performance degradation from fixes
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user journey validation

---

## Section 5: Scope & Implementation Approach

### 5.1 Protected Core Changes Required
- **Type Safety**: Remove all `any` types, add proper interfaces
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement comprehensive error handling
- **Security**: Add input validation and sanitization
- **Testing**: Establish test coverage for all protected core modules

### 5.2 External Component Changes Required
- **React Components**: Add error boundaries and TypeScript safety
- **Database Layer**: Fix schema validation and type mismatches
- **API Endpoints**: Add authentication and input validation
- **Frontend Security**: Implement XSS and injection protections

### 5.3 Story-Driven Implementation Strategy
This change will be decomposed into atomic, executable stories that can be implemented by specialist agents:

1. **Security Stories**: Input validation, authentication, sanitization
2. **TypeScript Stories**: Type safety, interface definitions, strict mode
3. **Error Handling Stories**: Error boundaries, promise handling, graceful degradation
4. **Architecture Stories**: Dependency cleanup, memory leak fixes, performance optimization
5. **Testing Stories**: Coverage establishment, security testing, integration validation

### 5.4 Agent Coordination Plan
- **Story Creation**: Context Engineer creates detailed, self-contained stories
- **Implementation**: Specialist agents (frontend, backend, security) execute stories
- **Quality Gates**: Automated verification after each story completion
- **Integration**: Final integration testing across all remediation changes
