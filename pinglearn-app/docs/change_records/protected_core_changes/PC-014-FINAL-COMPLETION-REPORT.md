## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Complete Security Stories** (Highest Priority)
   - **Why**: Security stories are P0-P1 priority
   - **Estimate**: 16-20 hours for all 4 stories
   - **Approach**: Sequential 6-phase workflow for each
   - **Order**: SEC-001 → SEC-003 → SEC-008 → SEC-009

2. **Fix Test Failures** (High Priority)
   - **Why**: 16.4% test failure rate needs resolution
   - **Estimate**: 3-4 hours
   - **Focus**: DisplayBuffer tests (concentrated failures)

3. **Complete ARCH-003** (Medium Priority)
   - **Why**: 85% complete, remaining 15% adds value
   - **Estimate**: 3-4 hours
   - **Components**: CachedRepository, tests, examples

4. **Update Documentation** (Low Priority)
   - **Why**: Reflect current completion status
   - **Estimate**: 1-2 hours
   - **Files**: MASTER-TRACKER.json, README updates

### Alternative Approach (If Time Constrained)

**Option 1: Accept Current State (90.6% Complete)**
- Document remaining 5 stories as "Future Work"
- Create comprehensive handoff document
- Provide detailed implementation guides for remaining stories

**Option 2: Implement 2 Critical Security Stories**
- Focus on SEC-001 and SEC-008 (highest impact)
- Brings completion to 94.3% (50/53 stories)
- Estimated: 8-10 hours

**Option 3: Quality Focus**
- Fix test failures (bring to 95%+ pass rate)
- Complete ARCH-003 to 100%
- Polish existing implementations
- Estimated: 6-8 hours
