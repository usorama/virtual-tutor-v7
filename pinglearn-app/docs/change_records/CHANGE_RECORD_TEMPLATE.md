   - Do NOT duplicate section headers
3. **Complete Sections 4-11** during planning
4. **Get approval** via Section 15
5. **Fill Section 12** during implementation
6. **Complete Sections 16-17** after implementation

### Required vs. Optional Sections
- **Required for All Changes**: Sections 1-3, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16
