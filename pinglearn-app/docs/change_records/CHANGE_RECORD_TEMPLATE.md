## Template Usage Notes

### Mandatory Sections
All sections marked with ⭐ CRITICAL are mandatory and must be completed thoroughly.

### Section Dependencies
- Section 3.2 (End-to-End Flow Analysis) informs all other sections
- Section 4 (Dependency Analysis) must be completed before Section 6 (Proposed Solution)
- Section 5 (Assumption Validation) often reveals need for additional change records

### Quality Gates
- **Gate 1**: Cannot proceed past Section 5 without validating all assumptions
- **Gate 2**: Cannot submit for approval without complete dependency analysis
- **Gate 3**: Cannot implement without stakeholder approval

### Success Criteria
A change record is complete when:
1. User can complete the full intended journey
2. All assumptions are validated
3. All dependencies are met or planned
4. All integration points are working
5. No surprises during implementation

**Remember**: It's better to identify gaps during planning than during implementation.
