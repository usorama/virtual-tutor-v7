# Apple Human Interface Guidelines - Core Principles

## Foundation Principles

### 1. Hierarchy
**Making important content prominent and easy to find**
- Creates clear visual organization
- Guides users through interface naturally
- Emphasizes primary actions and information

### 2. Harmony
**Creating cohesive experiences through consistency**
- Maintains consistent patterns across the interface
- Ensures visual elements work together
- Creates predictable user interactions

### 3. Consistency
**Building trust through familiar patterns**
- Uses standard UI elements appropriately
- Maintains consistent behavior across features
- Leverages platform conventions users already know

## Materials & Effects

### Liquid Glass Material
Apple's premium translucent material that reflects and refracts its surroundings.

#### Two Variants:

**1. Liquid Glass (Regular)**
- **Purpose**: For legibility and clear text rendering
- **Use Cases**: Controls, navigation bars, overlays with text
- **Properties**: Balanced transparency for optimal readability

**2. Liquid Glass (Clear)**
- **Purpose**: For media-focused content
- **Use Cases**: Video players, image overlays, media controls
- **Properties**: Higher transparency to showcase content beneath

#### Implementation Rules:
- ✅ **DO** use for controls and navigation
- ✅ **DO** apply to overlays and floating elements
- ❌ **DON'T** use for content layer items
- ❌ **DON'T** apply to primary content areas

## Typography System

### SF Pro Font Family
Apple's system font designed for optimal legibility across all sizes.

**Font Variants:**
- **SF Pro Display**: For text 20pt and larger
- **SF Pro Text**: For text smaller than 20pt
- **SF Pro Rounded**: Friendly, approachable variant
- **SF Mono**: For code and monospaced content

### Typography Scale (11 Sizes)
1. **Large Title** - 34pt
2. **Title 1** - 28pt
3. **Title 2** - 22pt
4. **Title 3** - 20pt
5. **Headline** - 17pt Semibold
6. **Body** - 17pt Regular
7. **Callout** - 16pt
8. **Subheadline** - 15pt
9. **Footnote** - 13pt
10. **Caption 1** - 12pt

## Visual Effects

### Depth & Dimension
- Use shadows to create hierarchy
- Apply blur effects for focus
- Implement smooth transitions

### Motion & Animation
- Purposeful animations that guide attention
- Smooth, natural transitions
- Respect reduced motion preferences

## Color Philosophy

### Restraint & Purpose
- Minimal color palette for focus
- Accent colors used sparingly
- High contrast for accessibility

### System Integration
- Respect system appearance (light/dark mode)
- Use semantic colors for meaning
- Maintain WCAG compliance

## Interaction Design

### Direct Manipulation
- Immediate visual feedback
- Gesture-based interactions where appropriate
- Physical metaphors for digital actions

### Progressive Disclosure
- Show essential information first
- Reveal complexity gradually
- Maintain context during navigation

## Accessibility

### Universal Design
- Design for everyone from the start
- Support assistive technologies
- Provide multiple ways to accomplish tasks

### Clear Communication
