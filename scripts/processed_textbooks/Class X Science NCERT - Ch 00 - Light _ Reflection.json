In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the\norigin (Fig. 9.9).  The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis\n(X’X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –\n(i) The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies\nthat the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand\nside.\n(ii) All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the\npole of the mirror.\n(iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along\n+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of\nthe origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.\n(iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis\n(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.\n(v) Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis\n(along –y-axis) are taken as negative.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 143\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in\nFig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain\nthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\n9.2.4  Mirror Formula and  Magnification\nIn a spherical mirror , the distance of the\nobject from its pole is called the object\ndistance (u).  The distance of the image from\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image\ndistance ( v). You alr eady know that the\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole\nis called the focal length ( f). There is a\nrelationship between these three quantities\ngiven by the mirr or for mula which is\nexpressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f+ = (9.1)\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the\nobject. You must use the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention while substituting numerical\nvalues for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula\nfor solving problems.\nMagnification\nMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to\nwhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\nIt is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the\nobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.\nIf h is the height of the object and h′ is the height of the image, then\nthe magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by\nm = \nHeight of the image ( )\nHeight of the object ( )\n′h\nh\nm = ′h\nh (9.2)\nThe magnification m is also related to the object distance ( u) and\nimage distance (v).  It can be expressed as:\nMagnification (m)  = ′ = −h\nh\nv\nu (9.3)\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis.  The height of the\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images.  However, it is to be\ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the\nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value\nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.\nFigure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nScience144\nExample 9.1\nA convex mirror used for rear-view on an automobile has a radius of\ncurvature of 3.00 m.

Where is the image located?\n9.3 REFRACTION OF LIGHT9.3 REFRACTION OF LIGHT9.3 REFRACTION OF LIGHT9.3 REFRACTION OF LIGHT9.3 REFRACTION OF LIGHT\nLight seems to travel along straight-line paths in a transparent medium.\nWhat happens when light enters from one transparent medium to\nanother? Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its\ndirection? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond\ncontaining water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab\nis placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed\nthrough the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil\npartly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced\nat the interface of air and water. You might have observed that a lemon\nkept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual\nsize, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for such\nexperiences?\nLet us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil,\npartly immersed in water. The light reaching you from the portion of the\npencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared\nto the part above water. This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at\nthe interface. For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when\nseen through a glass slab placed over it.\nDoes a pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent, if instead of\nwater, we use liquids like kerosene or turpentine? Will the letters appear\nto rise to the same height if we replace a glass slab with a transparent\nplastic slab? You will find that the extent of the ef fect is different for\ndifferent pair of media. These observations indicate that light does not\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nScience146\ntravel in the same direction in all media. It appears that when travelling\nobliquely from one medium to another, the direction of propagation of\nlight in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as\nrefraction of light. Let us understand this phenomenon further by doing\na few activities.\nActivity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7\n/square6Place a coin at the bottom of a bucket filled with water .\n/square6With your eye to a side above water , try to pick up the coin in one\ngo.

Does the coin becomes\nvisible again from your position?  How could this happen?\nThe coin becomes visible again on pouring water into the bowl. The\ncoin appears slightly raised above its actual position due to refraction of\nlight.\nActivity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9\n/square6Draw a thick straight line in ink, over a sheet of white paper placed\non a Table.\n/square6Place a glass slab over the line in such a way that one of its edges\nmakes an angle with the line.\n/square6Look at the portion of the line under the slab from the sides. What\ndo you observe? Does the line under the glass slab appear to be\nbent at the edges?\n/square6Next, place the glass slab such that it is normal to the line. What\ndo you observe now? Does the part of the line under the glass slab\nappear bent?\n/square6Look at the line from the top of the glass slab. Does the part of the\nline, beneath the slab, appear to be raised? Why does this happen?\n9.3.1 Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab\nTo understand the phenomenon of refraction of light through a glass\nslab, let us do an Activity.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 147\nIn this Activity, you will note, the light ray has changed its direction\nat points O and O′. Note that both the points O and O′ lie on surfaces\nseparating two transparent media. Draw a perpendicular NN’ to AB at O\nand another perpendicular MM′ to CD at O′. The light ray at point O has\nentered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to\nglass. Note that the light ray has bent towards\nthe normal. At O\n′, the light ray has entered\nfrom glass to air , that is, fr om a denser\nmedium to a rarer medium.  The light here\nhas bent away from the normal. Compare the\nangle of incidence with the angle of refraction\nat both refracting surfaces AB and CD.\nIn Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely\nincident on surface AB, called incident ray.\nOO\n′ is the refracted ray and O′ H is the\nemergent ray. Y ou may observe that the\nemergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nthe incident ray. Why does it happen so? The\nextent of bending of the ray of light at the\nopposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface)\nand CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular\nglass slab is equal and opposite. This is why\nthe ray emerges parallel to the incident ray.\nHowever, the light ray is shifted sidewar d\nslightly. What happens when a light ray is\nincident normally to the interface of two\nmedia? Try and find out.\nNow you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to\nchange in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to\nanother.  Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to\ncertain laws.\nActivity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10\n/square6Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\n/square6Place a rectangular glass slab over the sheet in the middle.\n/square6Draw the outline of the slab with a pencil.

Let EF meet AB at O.  Similarly, join the positions of tip\nof the pins G and H and produce it up to the edge CD.  Let HG\nmeet CD at O′.\n/square6Join O and O′.  Also produce EF up to P, as shown by a dotted line\nin Fig. 9.10.\nFigure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10Figure 9.10\nRefraction of light through a rectangular glass slab\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nScience148\nThe following are the laws of refraction of light.\n (i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface\nof two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the\nsame plane.\n(ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of\nrefraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for\nthe given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90o)\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\nsin\nsin\ni\nr  = constant (9.4)\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\nwith respect to the first.  Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1 .  In air, the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the r efractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11.  Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2.  The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21. This can be expressed in an equation form as\nn21=\nSpeed of light in medium 1 \nSpeed of light in medium 2 = v\nv\n1\n2\n(9.5)\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12. It is given\nby\nn12= Speed of light in medium 2 \nSpeed of light in medium 1 = v\nv\n2\n1\n(9.6)\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2\nis considered with respect to vacuum.  This is called the absolute refractive\nindex of the medium.  It is simply represented as n2. If c is the speed of\nFigure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 149\nThe ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.\nOptical density has a definite connotation.  It is not the same as mass density. We have\nbeen using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually\nmeans  ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other.  The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer.  The speed of light is higher in a rarer\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\nNote from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive\nindex, is optically denser than water, although its mass density is less\nthan water.\nMaterial Refractive Material Refractive\nmedium index medium index\nAir 1.0003 Canada 1.53\nBalsam\nIce 1.31\nWater 1.33 Rock salt 1.54\nAlcohol 1.36\nKerosene 1.44 Carbon 1.63\ndisulphide\nFused 1.46\nquartz Dense 1.65\nflint glass\nTurpentine 1.47\noil Ruby 1.71\nBenzene 1.50\nSapphire 1.77\nCrown 1.52\nglass Diamond  2.42\nlight in air and v is the speed of light in the medium, then, the refractive\nindex of the medium nm is given by\nnm = Speed of light in air \nSpeed of light in the medium = c\nv (9.7)\nThe absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive\nindex. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From\nthe Table you can know that the r efractive index of water, nw = 1.33.\nThis means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of\nlight in water is equal to 1.33.  Similarly, the refractive index of crown\nglass, ng =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places.  However, you\nneed not memorise the data.\nTable 9.3 Absolute refractive index of some material media\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nScience150\n9.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses\nYou might have seen watchmakers using a small magnifying glass to\nsee tiny parts. Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass\nwith your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle\nor at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We\nshall discuss these in this section.\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both\nsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\nthat a lens is bound by at least one spherical\nsurface. In such lenses, the other surface would\nbe plane.  A lens may have two spherical\nsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\nalso called converging lenses.  Similarly, a double\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\nsurfaces, curved inwards.  It is thicker at the\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\nare also called diverging lenses. A double concave\nlens is simply called a concave lens.\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,\nhas two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces\nforms a part of a sphere. The centres of these\nspheres are called centres of curvature of the lens.\nThe centre of curvature of a lens is usually\nrepresented by the letter C.  Since there are two\ncentres of curvature, we may represent them as C1 and C2. An imaginary\nstraight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is\ncalled its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It is\nQUESTIONS\n?"

The light from the Sun constitutes\nparallel rays of light.  These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp\nbright spot formed on the paper.  In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a\nlens.  What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens.\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci.  They\nare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the\nposition of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the\napproximate focal length of the lens.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nScience152\n9.3.4 Image Formation by Lenses\nLenses form images by refracting light. How do lenses form images?\nWhat is their nature? Let us study this for a convex lens first.\nActivity 9.12Activity 9.12Activity 9.12Activity 9.12Activity 9.12\n/square6Take a convex lens.  Find its approximate focal length in a way\ndescribed in Activity 9.11.\n/square6Draw five parallel straight lines, using chalk, on a long Table such\nthat the distance between the successive lines is equal to the\nfocal length of the lens.\n/square6Place the lens on a lens stand.  Place it on the central line such\nthat the optical centre of the lens lies just over the line.\n/square6The two lines on either side of the lens correspond to F and 2F of\nthe lens respectively.  Mark them with appropriate letters such as\n2F1, F1, F2 and 2F2, respectively.\n/square6Place a burning candle, far beyond 2F 1 to the left. Obtain a clear\nsharp image on a screen on the opposite side of the lens.\n/square6Note down the nature, position and relative size of the image.\n/square6Repeat this Activity by placing object just behind 2F 1, between F 1\nand 2F 1 at F 1, between F 1 and O. Note down and tabulate your\nobservations.\nThe nature, position and relative size of the image formed by convex\nlens for various positions of the object is summarised in Table 9.4.\nLet us now do an Activity to study the nature, position and relative\nsize of the image formed by a concave lens.\nTable 9.4 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a convex lens for various\npositions of the object\nPosition of the Position of Relative size of Nature of\nobject the image  the image the image\nAt infinity At focus F2 Highly diminished, Real and inverted\npoint-sized\nBeyond 2F1 Between F2  and 2F 2 Diminished Real and inverted\nAt 2F1 At 2F2 Same size Real and inverted\nBetween F1 and 2F1 Beyond 2F2 Enlarged Real and inverted\nAt focus F1 At infinity Infinitely large or Real and inverted\nhighly enlarged\nBetween focus F 1 On the same side Enlarged Virtual and erect\nand of the lens as the\noptical centre O object\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 20 ---\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 153\nThe summary of the above Activity is given in Table 9.5 below.\nActivity 9.13Activity 9.13Activity 9.13Activity 9.13Activity 9.13\n/square6Take a concave lens. Place it on a lens stand.\n/square6Place a burning candle on one side of the lens.\n/square6Look through the lens from the other side and observe the image.\nTry to get the image on a screen, if possible. If not, observe the\nimage directly through the lens.\n/square6Note down the nature, relative size and approximate position of\nthe image.\n/square6Move the candle away from the lens.  Note the change in the size\nof the image. What happens to the size of the image when the\ncandle is placed too far away from the lens.\nWhat conclusion can you draw from this Activity? A concave lens\nwill always give a virtual, erect and diminished image, irrespective of the\nposition of the object.\n9.3.5 Image Formation in Lenses Using Ray Diagrams\n We can represent image formation by lenses using ray diagrams. Ray\ndiagrams will also help us to study the nature, position and relative size\nof the image formed by lenses. For drawing ray diagrams in lenses, alike\nof spherical mirrors, we consider any two of the following rays –\n(i) A ray of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after\nrefraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focus\non the other side of the lens, as shown in Fig. 9.13 (a). In case of\na concave lens,\nthe ray appears\nto diverge from\nthe principal\nfocus located\non the same\nside of the lens,\nas shown in\nFig. 9.13 (b).\n(a) (b)\nTable 9.5 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens for various\npositions of the object\nPosition of the Position of Relative size of Nature of\nobject the image  the image the image\nAt infinity At focus F1 Highly diminished, Virtual and erect\npoint-sized\nBetween infinity and Between focus F 1 Diminished Virtual and erect\noptical centre O and optical centre O\nof the lens\nFigure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 21 ---\nScience154\n(ii) A ray of light passing\nthrough a principal\nfocus, after refraction\nfrom a convex lens, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nshown in Fig. 9.14 (a). A\nray of light appearing to\nmeet at the principal\nfocus of a concave lens,\nafter refraction, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nshown in Fig.9.14 (b).\n(iii) A ray of light passing\nthrough the optical\ncentre of a lens will\nemerge without any\ndeviation. This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.15(a)\nand Fig.9.15 (b).\n(b)(a)\n(b)(a)\nThe ray diagrams for the image formation in a convex lens for a few\npositions of the object are shown in Fig. 9.16. The ray diagrams\nrepresenting the image formation in a concave lens for various positions\nof the object are shown in Fig. 9.17.\nFigure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14\nFigure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 22 ---\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 155\nFigure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16  The position, size and the nature of the image formed by\na convex lens for various positions of the object\nFigure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens\n9.3.6 Sign Convention for Spherical Lenses\nFor lenses, we follow sign convention, similar to the one used for spherical\nmirrors. We apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all\nmeasurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According\nto the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of\na concave lens is negative. Y ou must take car e to apply appropriate\nsigns for the values of u, v, f, object height h and image height h′.\n9.3.7 Lens Formula and Magnification\nAs we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula for\nspherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between object-\ndistance (u), image-distance (v) and the focal length (f ).  The lens formula\nis expressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f− = (9.8)\nThe lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situations\nfor any spherical lens. Take proper care of the signs of different quantities,\nwhile putting numerical values for solving problems relating to lenses.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 23 ---\nScience156\nMagnification\nThe magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for spherical\nmirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height\nof the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m . If h is the\nheight of the object and h\n′ is the height of the image given by a lens, then\nthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,\nm = Height of the Image\nHeight of the object = h\nh\n′ (9.9)\nMagnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance\nu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by\nMagnification (m ) = h′/h = v/u (9.10)\nExample 9.3\nA concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should\nthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.\nSolution\nA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\nof the object.\nImage-distance v = –10 cm;\nFocal length f = –15 cm;\nObject-distance u = ?\nSince \n1 1 1\nv u f− =\nor,\n1 1 1–u v f=\n( )\n1 1 1 1 1– ––10 –15 10 15u = = +\n1 3 2 1\n30 30u\n− += = −\nor,  u = – 30 cm\nThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.\nMagnification m = v/u\nm = −\n− = +10cm\n30cm\n1\n3 0.33;\nThe positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image\nis one-third of the size of the object.\nExample 9.4\nA 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the\nlens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also\nfind its magnification.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 24 ---\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 157\nSolution\nHeight of the object h = + 2.0 cm;\nFocal length f = + 10 cm;\nobject-distance u = –15 cm;\nImage-distance v = ?\nHeight of the image h′ = ?\nSince\n1 1 1\nv u f− =\nor,\n1 1 1\nv u f= +\n1 1 1 1 1\n( 15) 10 15 10v = + = − +−\n1 2 3 1\n30 30v\n− += =\nor, v = + 30 cm\nThe positive sign of v shows that the image is formed at a distance of\n30 cm on the other side of the optical centre.  The image is real and\ninverted.\nMagnification m = 'h v\nh u=\nor, h′ = h (v/u)\nHeight of the image, h′ = (2.0) (+30/–15) = – 4.0 cm\nMagnification m =  v/u\nor, 30cm 215cmm += = −−\nThe negative signs of m and h′ show that the image is inverted and\nreal. It is formed below the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image,\n4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the\nlens. The image is two times enlarged.\n9.3.8 Power of a Lens\nYou have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge\nlight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined\nas the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P.  The\npower P of a lens of focal length \nf is given by\nP = \n1\nf (9.11)\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 25 ---\nScience158\nThe SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.\nIf f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1 .\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\nconcave lens is negative.\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers.  Let us\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.  This means the lens\nprescribed is convex.  The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\na lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m.  The lens is concave.\nMany optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P ) of the lenses placed\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, …   as\nP = P1 + P2 + P3 + …\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses\nof known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates\nthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\nof two lenses of power  + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems\nto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.  Such a lens system,\nconsisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of\ncamera, microscopes and telescopes.\nQUESTIONS\n?"

In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the\norigin (Fig. 9.9).  The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis\n(X’X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –\n(i) The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies\nthat the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand\nside.\n(ii) All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the\npole of the mirror.\n(iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along\n+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of\nthe origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.\n(iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis\n(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.\n(v) Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis\n(along –y-axis) are taken as negative.\n2024-25",

These sign conventions are applied to obtain\nthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\n9.2.4  Mirror Formula and  Magnification\nIn a spherical mirror , the distance of the\nobject from its pole is called the object\ndistance (u).  The distance of the image from\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image\ndistance ( v). You alr eady know that the\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole\nis called the focal length ( f). There is a\nrelationship between these three quantities\ngiven by the mirr or for mula which is\nexpressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f+ = (9.1)\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the\nobject. You must use the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention while substituting numerical\nvalues for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula\nfor solving problems.\nMagnification\nMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to\nwhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\nIt is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the\nobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.\nIf h is the height of the object and h′ is the height of the image, then\nthe magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by\nm = \nHeight of the image ( )\nHeight of the object ( )\n′h\nh\nm = ′h\nh (9.2)\nThe magnification m is also related to the object distance ( u) and\nimage distance (v).  It can be expressed as:\nMagnification (m)  = ′ = −h\nh\nv\nu (9.3)\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis.  The height of the\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images.  However, it is to be\ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the\nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value\nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.\nFigure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\n2024-25",

This law is also known as Snell’s law of\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90o)\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\nsin\nsin\ni\nr  = constant (9.4)\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\nwith respect to the first.  Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1 .  In air, the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the r efractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11.  Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2.  The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21. This can be expressed in an equation form as\nn21=\nSpeed of light in medium 1 \nSpeed of light in medium 2 = v\nv\n1\n2\n(9.5)\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12. It is given\nby\nn12= Speed of light in medium 2 \nSpeed of light in medium 1 = v\nv\n2\n1\n(9.6)\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2\nis considered with respect to vacuum.  This is called the absolute refractive\nindex of the medium.  It is simply represented as n2. If c is the speed of\nFigure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11\n2024-25",

It is not the same as mass density. We have\nbeen using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually\nmeans  ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other.  The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer.  The speed of light is higher in a rarer\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\nNote from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive\nindex, is optically denser than water, although its mass density is less\nthan water.\nMaterial Refractive Material Refractive\nmedium index medium index\nAir 1.0003 Canada 1.53\nBalsam\nIce 1.31\nWater 1.33 Rock salt 1.54\nAlcohol 1.36\nKerosene 1.44 Carbon 1.63\ndisulphide\nFused 1.46\nquartz Dense 1.65\nflint glass\nTurpentine 1.47\noil Ruby 1.71\nBenzene 1.50\nSapphire 1.77\nCrown 1.52\nglass Diamond  2.42\nlight in air and v is the speed of light in the medium, then, the refractive\nindex of the medium nm is given by\nnm = Speed of light in air \nSpeed of light in the medium = c\nv (9.7)\nThe absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive\nindex.

The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays?

Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\nalso called converging lenses.  Similarly, a double\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\nsurfaces, curved inwards.  It is thicker at the\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\nare also called diverging lenses.

A ray of light through the optical\ncentre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective\ndiameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.\nWe shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose\naperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of\ncurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are\ncalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays\nof light are incident on a lens?  Let us do an Activity to understand this.\nActivity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or through a lens while\ndoing this Activity or otherwise.

Obtain a sharp\nbright image of the Sun.\n/square6Hold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while.  Keep\nobserving the paper. What happened? Why? Recall your experience\nin Activity 9.2.\nThe paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fire\nafter a while.  Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutes\nparallel rays of light.  These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp\nbright spot formed on the paper.  In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a\nlens.  What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens.\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci.  They\nare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the\nposition of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the\napproximate focal length of the lens.\n2024-25",

We apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all\nmeasurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According\nto the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of\na concave lens is negative. Y ou must take car e to apply appropriate\nsigns for the values of u, v, f, object height h and image height h′.\n9.3.7 Lens Formula and Magnification\nAs we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula for\nspherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between object-\ndistance (u), image-distance (v) and the focal length (f ).  The lens formula\nis expressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f− = (9.8)\nThe lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situations\nfor any spherical lens. Take proper care of the signs of different quantities,\nwhile putting numerical values for solving problems relating to lenses.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 23 ---\nScience156\nMagnification\nThe magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for spherical\nmirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height\nof the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m . If h is the\nheight of the object and h\n′ is the height of the image given by a lens, then\nthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,\nm = Height of the Image\nHeight of the object = h\nh\n′ (9.9)\nMagnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance\nu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by\nMagnification (m ) = h′/h = v/u (9.10)\nExample 9.3\nA concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should\nthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.\nSolution\nA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\nof the object.\nImage-distance v = –10 cm;\nFocal length f = –15 cm;\nObject-distance u = ?\nSince \n1 1 1\nv u f− =\nor,\n1 1 1–u v f=\n( )\n1 1 1 1 1– ––10 –15 10 15u = = +\n1 3 2 1\n30 30u\n− += = −\nor,  u = – 30 cm\nThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.\nMagnification m = v/u\nm = −\n− = +10cm\n30cm\n1\n3 0.33;\nThe positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image\nis one-third of the size of the object.\nExample 9.4\nA 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the\nlens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also\nfind its magnification.\n2024-25",

The image is two times enlarged.\n9.3.8 Power of a Lens\nYou have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge\nlight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined\nas the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P.  The\npower P of a lens of focal length \nf is given by\nP = \n1\nf (9.11)\n2024-25",

      "content": "--- Page 25 ---\nScience158\nThe SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.\nIf f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1 .\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\nconcave lens is negative.\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers.  Let us\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.  This means the lens\nprescribed is convex.  The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\na lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m.  The lens is concave.\nMany optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P ) of the lenses placed\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, …   as\nP = P1 + P2 + P3 + …\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses\nof known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates\nthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\nof two lenses of power  + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems\nto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.  Such a lens system,\nconsisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of\ncamera, microscopes and telescopes.\nQUESTIONS\n?",
