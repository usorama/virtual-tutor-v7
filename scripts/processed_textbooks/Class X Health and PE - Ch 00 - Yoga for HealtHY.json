After this, the person is asked to come back by following the \nsteps as mentioned in the ‘come back’ phase.\n    Remember the following points\nDos Dont’s\n • Relax all parts of body one by one.\n • Focus on the part of body which is being named. \n • Follow the instructions properly.\n • Do not tense the muscles of body.\n • Do not sleep.\nBenefits\n • It reduces anxiety and tension.  \n • It activates parasympathetic system and thereby helps \nin management of stress related problems.\nChap-8_New.indd   157 8/24/2020   11:42:42 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 26 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n158\n • It reduces bodily tension and relaxes whole body.\n • It helps to reduce blood pressure.\nLimitation\n • In case of depression this practice should be avoided.\nMeditation\nMeditation is an important yogic practice which is commonly \nused for relaxation and stress management. Meditation \nprovides rest and peace of mind. During meditation, all kinds \nof thoughts which are causing stress are eliminated. This \nresults into an enhanced state of physical and emotional well-\nbeing. After meditation, the person feels fresh and develops \na new perspective on stressful situations. Meditation helps \nto reduce negative emotions and increases self-awareness.\nYoga for heaLthY Living\nIn this section, some advanced asanas are given which you \ncan learn at this stage. These are balancing asanas and more \ndifficult as compared to the previously learnt asanas. These \nasanas will also help you remain healthy. \nShirshasana\nShirsha, a Sanskrit word means ‘head’. In this posture one \nstands on one’s head, hence it is called Shirshasana (Head \nStand Posture). \nLet us perform Shrishasana by following the steps given \nbelow."
