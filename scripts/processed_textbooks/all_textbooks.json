Why do the iron filings arrange in such a pattern? What does\nthis pattern demonstrate?  The magnet exerts its influence in the region\nsurrounding it.  Therefore the iron filings experience a force.  The force\nthus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region\nsurrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,\nis said to have a magnetic field.  The lines along which the iron filings\nalign themselves represent magnetic field lines.\nAre there other ways of obtaining magnetic field lines around a bar\nmagnet?  Yes, you can yourself draw the field lines of a bar magnet.\nActivity 12.3Activity 12.3Activity 12.3Activity 12.3Activity 12.3\n/square6Take a small compass and a bar magnet.\n/square6Place the magnet on a sheet of white paper fixed on a drawing\nboard, using some adhesive material.\n/square6Mark the boundary of the magnet.\n/square6Place the compass near the north pole of the magnet. How does\nit behave? The south pole of the needle points towards the north\npole of the magnet. The north pole of the compass is directed\naway from the north pole of the magnet.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 197\nMagnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.\nThe direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a\nnorth pole of the compass needle moves inside it.  Therefore it is taken\nby convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at\nthe south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4).\nInside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its\nnorth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves.\nThe relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of\ncloseness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force acting\non the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are\ncrowded (see Fig. 12.4).\nNo two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would\nmean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point\ntowards two directions, which is not possible.\n12.2\n12.212.2 12.212.2 MA MAMA MAMAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENTGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT --- --C CC CCARRYING ARRYINGARRYING ARRYINGARRYING\nCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTORCONDUCTOR\nIn Activity 12.1, we have seen that an electric current through a\nmetallic conductor produces a magnetic field around it. In order to\nfind the direction of the field produced let us repeat the activity in the\nfollowing way  –\nFigure 12.3Figure 12.3Figure 12.3Figure 12.3Figure 12.3\nDrawing a magnetic field line with the help of a\ncompass needle\n/square6Mark the position of two ends of the needle.\n/square6Now move the needle to a new position\nsuch that its south pole occupies the\nposition previously occupied by its north\npole.\n/square6In this way, proceed step by step till you\nreach the south pole of the magnet as\nshown in Fig. 12.3.\n/square6Join the points marked on the paper by a\nsmooth curve.  This curve represents\na field line.\n/square6Repeat the above procedure and draw as\nmany lines as you can. Y ou will get a\npattern shown in Fig. 12.4. These lines\nrepresent the magnetic field around the\nmagnet. These are known as magnetic\nfield lines.\n/square6Observe the deflection in the compass\nneedle as you move it along a field line.\nThe deflection increases as the needle is\nmoved towards the poles.\nFigure 12.4Figure 12.4Figure 12.4Figure 12.4Figure 12.4\nField lines around a bar magnet\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nScience198\n12.2.1 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Straight\nConductor\nWhat determines the pattern of the magnetic field generated by a current\nthrough a conductor? Does the pattern depend on the shape of the\nconductor? We shall investigate this with an activity.\nWe shall first consider the patter n of the magnetic field ar ound a\nstraight conductor carrying current.\nActivity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4Activity 12.4\n/square6Take a long straight copper wire, two or three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key. Connect\nall of them in series as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a).\n/square6Place the straight wire parallel to and over a compass needle.\n/square6Plug the key in the circuit.\n/square6Observe the direction of deflection of the north pole of the needle. If the current flows from\nnorth to south, as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a), the north pole of the compass needle would move\ntowards the east.\n/square6Replace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig. 12.5 (b). This would result in\nthe change of the direction of current through the copper wire, that is, from south to\nnorth.\n/square6Observe the change in the dir ection of deflection of the needle. Y ou will see that now the\nneedle moves in opposite direction, that is, towards the west [Fig. 12.5 (b)]. It means that\nthe direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reversed.\nFigure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5Figure 12.5 A simple electric circuit in which a straight copper wire is placed parallel to and over a compass\nneedle. The deflection in the needle becomes opposite when the direction of the current is reversed.\n(a) (b)\nActivity 12.5Activity 12.5Activity 12.5Activity 12.5Activity 12.5\n/square6Take a battery (12 V), a variable resistance (or a rheostat), an\nammeter (0–5 A), a plug key, connecting wires and a long straight\nthick copper wire.\n/square6Insert the thick wire through the centre, normal to the plane of a\nrectangular cardboard.  Take care that the cardboard is fixed and\ndoes not slide up or down.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current 199\nWhat happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a\ngiven point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary\nthe current in the wir\ne. We find that the deflection in the needle also\nchanges. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases.\nIt indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given\npoint increases as the current through the wire increases.\nWhat happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved\naway from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the\nsame? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the\nconducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We see\nthat the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field\nproduced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance\nfrom it increases. From Fig. 12.6, it can be noticed that the concentric\ncircles representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straight\nwire become larger and larger as we move away from it.\n12.2.2 Right-Hand Thumb Rule\nA convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated\nwith a current-carrying conductor is given in Fig. 12.7.\n/square6Connect the copper wire vertically between the\npoints X and Y, as shown in Fig. 12.6 (a), in\nseries with the battery, a plug and key.\n/square6Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the\ncardboard. (You may use a salt sprinkler for this\npurpose.)\n/square6Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed\nposition and note the current through the\nammeter.\n/square6Close the key so that a current flows through\nthe wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed\nbetween the points X and Y remains vertically\nstraight.\n/square6Gently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe\nthe patter n of the ir on filings. Y ou would find\nthat the iron filings align themselves showing\na pattern of concentric circles around the\ncopper wire (Fig. 12.6).\n/square6What do these concentric circles represent?\nThey represent the magnetic field lines.\n/square6How can the direction of the magnetic field be\nfound? Place a compass at a point (say P) over\na circle. Observe the direction of the needle. The\ndirection of the north pole of the compass\nneedle would give the direction of the field lines\nproduced by the electric current through the\nstraight wire at point P . Show the dir ection by\nan arrow.\n/square6Does the direction of magnetic field lines get\nreversed if the direction of current through the\nstraight copper wire is reversed? Check it.\nFigure 12.6Figure 12.6Figure 12.6Figure 12.6Figure 12.6\n(a) A pattern of concentric circles indicating\nthe field lines of a magnetic field around a\nstraight conducting wire. The arrows in the\ncircles show the direction of the field lines.\n(b) A close up of the pattern obtained.\n(a)\n(b)\nVariable\nresistance\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nScience200\nImagine that you are holding a current-carrying straight\nconductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards\nthe direction of current. Then your fingers will wrap around the\nconductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as\nshown in Fig. 12.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule*.\nExample 12.1\nA current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west\ndirection. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly\nbelow it and at a point directly above it?\nSolution\nThe current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand\nthumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or\nabove the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,\nwhen viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed\nfrom the west end.\nFigure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7\nRight-hand thumb rule\n* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a\ncorkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of\ncorkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field.\n12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a\nCircular Loop\nWe have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines\nproduced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose\nthis straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a\ncurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? We know that the magnetic field pr\noduced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic\nfield around it would become larger and larger as we move\naway from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nappear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\ncurrent would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nstraight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right\nhand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire\ncontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop.\nFigure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8\nMagnetic field lines of the field\nproduced by a current-carrying\ncircular loop\n?\nQUESTIONS"

The pattern\nof the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid is\nshown in Fig. 12.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the\nmagnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). Do they look\nsimilar? Yes, they ar\ne similar. In fact, one end of the solenoid\nbehaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the\nsouth pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of\nparallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is\nthe same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is\nuniform inside the solenoid.\nA strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be\nused to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron,\nwhen placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11). The magnet so formed is\ncalled an electromagnet.\nFigure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10\nField lines of the magnetic field\nthrough and around a current\ncarrying solenoid.\nFigure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11\nA current-carrying solenoid coil\nis used to magnetise steel rod\ninside it – an electromagnet.\nQUESTIONS\n?"

It\nshows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the\ndirection of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments\nhave shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude\nof the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles\nto the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a\nsimple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.\nIn Activity 12.7, we considered the\ndirection of the current and that of the magnetic\nfield perpendicular to each other and found\nthat the force is perpendicular to both of them.\nThe three directions can be illustrated through\na simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule.\nAccording to this rule, stretch the thumb,\nforefinger and middle finger of your left hand\nsuch that they are mutually perpendicular\n(Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in the\ndirection of magnetic field and the second\nfinger in the direction of current, then the\nthumb will point in the direction of motion or\nthe force acting on the conductor.\nDevices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields\ninclude electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, micr\nophones\nand measuring instruments.\nExample 12.2\nAn electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown\nin Fig. 12.14.

One of the wires in this supply, usually with\nred insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with\nblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the\npotential difference between the two is 220 V.\nAt the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric pr\ness, toaster, table fan,\nrefrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock."

In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other.\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket."

Therefore it is taken\nby convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at\nthe south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4).\nInside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its\nnorth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves.\nThe relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of\ncloseness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force acting\non the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are\ncrowded (see Fig. 12.4).\nNo two field-lines are found to cross each other.

In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases.\nIt indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given\npoint increases as the current through the wire increases.\nWhat happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved\naway from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the\nsame? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the\nconducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We see\nthat the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field\nproduced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance\nfrom it increases.

Then your fingers will wrap around the\nconductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as\nshown in Fig. 12.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule*.\nExample 12.1\nA current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west\ndirection. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly\nbelow it and at a point directly above it?\nSolution\nThe current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand\nthumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or\nabove the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,\nwhen viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed\nfrom the west end.\nFigure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7\nRight-hand thumb rule\n* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule.

Suppose\nthis straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a\ncurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? We know that the magnetic field pr\noduced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic\nfield around it would become larger and larger as we move\naway from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nappear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\ncurrent would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nstraight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right\nhand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire\ncontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop.\nFigure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8\nMagnetic field lines of the field\nproduced by a current-carrying\ncircular loop\n?\nQUESTIONS",

The pattern\nof the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid is\nshown in Fig. 12.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the\nmagnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). Do they look\nsimilar? Yes, they ar\ne similar. In fact, one end of the solenoid\nbehaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the\nsouth pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of\nparallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is\nthe same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is\nuniform inside the solenoid.\nA strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be\nused to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron,\nwhen placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11). The magnet so formed is\ncalled an electromagnet.\nFigure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10Figure 12.10\nField lines of the magnetic field\nthrough and around a current\ncarrying solenoid.\nFigure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11Figure 12.11\nA current-carrying solenoid coil\nis used to magnetise steel rod\ninside it – an electromagnet.\nQUESTIONS\n?",

It\nshows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the\ndirection of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments\nhave shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude\nof the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles\nto the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a\nsimple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.\nIn Activity 12.7, we considered the\ndirection of the current and that of the magnetic\nfield perpendicular to each other and found\nthat the force is perpendicular to both of them.\nThe three directions can be illustrated through\na simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule.\nAccording to this rule, stretch the thumb,\nforefinger and middle finger of your left hand\nsuch that they are mutually perpendicular\n(Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in the\ndirection of magnetic field and the second\nfinger in the direction of current, then the\nthumb will point in the direction of motion or\nthe force acting on the conductor.\nDevices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields\ninclude electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, micr\nophones\nand measuring instruments.\nExample 12.2\nAn electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown\nin Fig. 12.14. The direction of force acting on the electron will be\n(a) to the right.\n(b) to the left.\n(c) out of the page.\n(d) into the page.\nSolution\nAnswer is option (d). The direction of force is perpendicular to the\ndirection of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming’s left hand\nrule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction\nof motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.\nFigure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13Figure 12.13\nFleming’s left-hand rule\nFigure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14Figure 12.14\nQUESTIONS\n?",

One of the wires in this supply, usually with\nred insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with\nblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the\npotential difference between the two is 220 V.\nAt the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric pr\ness, toaster, table fan,\nrefrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock.",

Even weak ion currents that\ntravel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch\nsomething, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. This\nimpulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and are\nabout one-billionth of the earth’s magnetic field. Two main organs in the human\nbody where the magnetic field produced is significant, are the heart and the brain. The\nmagnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body\nparts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysis\nof these images helps in medical diagnosis.

In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other.\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.",

For this, collect the samples of following metals –\naluminium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, zinc and sodium.\n Most non-metals produce acidic oxides when dissolve in water. On\nthe other hand, most metals, give rise to basic oxides. You will be learning\nmore about these metal oxides in the next section.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nMetals and Non-metals 41\n3.2.1 What happens when Metals are bur nt in Air?\nYou have seen in Activity 3.8 that magnesium burns in air with a dazzling\nwhite flame. Do all metals react in the same manner? Let us check by\nperforming the following Activity.\nActivity 3.9Activity 3.9Activity 3.9Activity 3.9Activity 3.9\nCAUTION: The following activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\nIt would be better if students wear eye protection.\n/square6Hold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try\nburning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples.\n/square6Collect the product if formed.\n/square6Let the products and the metal surface cool down.\n/square6Which metals burn easily?\n/square6What flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt?\n/square6How does the metal surface appear after burning?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity\ntowards oxygen.\n/square6Are the products soluble in water?\nAlmost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.\nMetal  +  Oxygen →  Metal oxide\n For example, when copper is heated in air, it combines with oxygen\nto form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.\n2Cu  +  O2  →   2CuO\n(Copper)      (Copper(II) oxide)\nSimilarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.\n4Al + 3O2 →  2Al2O3\n(Aluminium) (Aluminium oxide)\nRecall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.\nWe have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some metal\noxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as\nbasic behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as\nbases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.\nAluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases –\nAl2O3 + 6HCl → 2AlCl3 + 3H2O\nAl2O3 + 2NaOH → 2NaAlO2 + H2O\n(Sodium\naluminate)\n Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve\nin water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in\nwater to produce alkalis as follows –\nNa2O(s) + H2O(l) →  2NaOH(aq)\nK2O(s) + H2O(l) →  2KOH(aq)\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nScience42\nWe have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not r eact with\noxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities\ntowards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures.\nDo You Know?\nAnodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it\nresistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the\noxide layer thicker.  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode\nreacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer.  This oxide layer can\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.\nBut burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a\nconclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.\n3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with Water?\nActivity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10Activity 3.10\nCAUTION: This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\n/square6Collect the samples of the same metals as in Activity 3.9.\n/square6Put small pieces of the samples separately in beakers half-filled\nwith cold water .\n/square6Which metals reacted with cold water? Arrange them in the\nincreasing order of their r eactivity with cold water .\n/square6Did any metal produce fire on water?\n/square6Does any metal start floating after some time?\n/square6Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers\nhalf-filled with hot water .\n/square6For the metals that did not r eact with hot water , arrange the\napparatus as shown in Fig. 3.3 and observe their reaction with steam.\n/square6Which metals did not react even with steam?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with water.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nMetals and Non-metals 43\nMetals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen\ngas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form\nmetal hydroxide. But all metals do not react with water.\nMetal + Water → Metal oxide + Hydrogen\nMetal oxide + Water → Metal hydroxide\nMetals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water. In\ncase of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic\nthat the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.\n2K(s)   + 2H2O(l) →  2KOH(aq)  +  H2(g) + heat energy\n2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) →  2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat energy\nThe reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is\nnot sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.\nCa(s) + 2H2O(l) →  Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)\nCalcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed\nstick to the surface of the metal.\nMagnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water\nto form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due\nto the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.\nMetals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or\nhot water. But they react with steam to form the metal oxide and hydrogen.\n2Al(s) + 3H2O(g) →  Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) →  Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\nMetals such as lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with water at all.\n3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with Acids?\nYou have alr\neady learnt that metals react with acids to give a salt and\nhydrogen gas.\nFigure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3Figure 3.3  Action of steam on a metal\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nScience44\nMetal + Dilute acid →  Salt + Hydrogen\nBut do all metals react in the same manner? Let us find out.\nActivity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11Activity 3.11\n/square6Collect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again.\nIf the samples ar e tar nished, rub them clean with sand paper .\nCAUTION:  Do not take sodium and potassium as they react\nvigorously even with cold water .\n/square6Put the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute\nhydrochloric acid.\n/square6Suspend thermometers in the test tubes, so that their bulbs are\ndipped in the acid.\n/square6Observe the rate of formation of bubbles carefully.\n/square6Which metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid?\n/square6With which metal did you record the highest temperature?\n/square6Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute\nacids.\nWrite equations for the reactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc\nand iron with dilute hydrochloric acid.\nHydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is\nbecause HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H2 produced to\nwater and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N 2O, NO,\nNO2). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute\nHNO3 to evolve H2 gas.\nYou must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of formation\nof bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was\nalso the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the\norder Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen and\nthe temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does\nnot react with dilute HCl.\nDo You Know?\nAqua regia, (Latin for ‘royal water’) is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated\nhydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It can dissolve\ngold, even though neither of these acids can do so alone. Aqua regia  is a highly\ncorrosive, fuming liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is able to dissolve gold and\nplatinum.\n3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of other Metal\nSalts?\nActivity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12Activity 3.12\n/square6Take a clean wire of copper and an iron nail.\n/square6Put the copper wire in a solution of iron sulphate and the iron\nnail in a solution of copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig. 3.4).\n/square6Record your observations after 20 minutes.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nMetals and Non-metals 45\n/square6In which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred?\n/square6On what basis can you say that a reaction has actually taken\nplace?\n/square6Can you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10\nand 3.11?\n/square6Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction that has taken\nplace.\n/square6Name the type of reaction.\nReactive metals can displace less\nreactive metals from their compounds in\nsolution or molten form.\nWe have seen in the previous sections\nthat all metals are not equally reactive. We\nchecked the reactivity of various metals\nwith oxygen, water and acids. But all\nmetals do not react with these reagents.\nSo we were not able to put all the metal\nsamples we had collected in decreasing\norder of their reactivity. Displacement\nreactions studied in Chapter 1 give better\nevidence about the reactivity of metals. It\nis simple and easy if metal A displaces\nmetal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.\nMetal A + Salt solution of B →  Salt solution of A + Metal B\nWhich metal, copper or iron, is more reactive according to your\nobservations in Activity 3.12?\n3.2.5 The Reactivity Series\nThe reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their\ndecreasing activities. After performing displacement experiments\n(Activities 1.9 and 3.12), the following series, (Table 3.2) known as the\nreactivity or activity series has been developed.\nTable 3.2 Activity series : Relative reactivities of metals\nK Potassium Most reactive\nNa Sodium\nCa Calcium\nMg Magnesium\nAl Aluminium\nZn Zinc Reactivity decreases\nFe Iron\nPb Lead\n[H] [Hydrogen]\nCu Copper\nHg Mercury\nAg Silver\nAu Gold Least reactive\nFigure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4Figure 3.4\nReaction of metals with\nsalt solutions\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nScience46\n?\nQUESTIONS"

We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements\nas a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\nsome metals and non-metals.\nWe can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its\noutermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell\nnow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet.

These compounds are generally brittle and\nbreak into pieces when pressure is applied.\n(ii) Melting and Boiling points : Ionic compounds have high melting\nand boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable\namount of ener gy is r equired to br eak the str ong inter -ionic\nattraction.\n(iii) Solubility : Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in\nwater and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.\n(iv) Conduction of Electricity : The conduction of electricity through\na solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution\nof an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the\nopposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the\nsolution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct\nelectricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible\ndue to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct\nelectricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state\nsince the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely\ncharged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move\nfreely and conduct electricity.\nQUESTIONS\n?\n1.

Seawater also contains\nsome soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.\nThe elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust,\nare known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high\npercentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted\nfrom it. These minerals are called ores.\n3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\nYou have lear nt about the r eactivity series of metals. Having this\nknowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its\nore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some\nare found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of\nthe activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nScience50\nstate. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the\nfree state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as\ntheir sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series\n(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in\nnature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s\ncrust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that\nthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very\nreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\nThus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques\nare to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.\nK\nNa\nCa\nMg\nAl\nZn\nFe\nPb\nCu\nAg\nAu\nReduction using\ncarbon\nFound in native\nstate\nElectrolysis\nFigure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9Figure 3.9\nActivity series and\nrelated metallurgy\nFigure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10Figure 3.10  Steps involved in the extraction of metals from ores\n3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores\nOres mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts\nof impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must\nbe removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes\nSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from\nores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is\nexplained in detail in the following sections.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nMetals and Non-metals 51\nused for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences\nbetween the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore.\nDifferent separation techniques are  accordingly employed.\n3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these\nmetals can be  reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\n(HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted\ninto mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury\non further heating.\n2HgS(s) + 3O (g) 2HgO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2\nHeat →  \n2HgO(s) 2Hg(l) + O (g) 2\nHeat →  \nSimilarly, copper which is found as Cu2S in nature can be obtained\nfrom its ore by just heating in air.\n2Cu S + 3O (g) 2Cu O(s) + 2SO (g)\n2Cu O + Cu S \n2 2 2 2\n2 2\nHeat\nHeat\n →   \n →    6Cu(s) + SO (g)2\n3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series\nThe metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead,\ncopper, are moderately reactive. These are usually present as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows –\nRoasting\n2ZnS(s) + 3O (g) 2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2\nHeat →   \nCalcination\nZnCO (s) ZnO(s) + CO (g)3 2\nHeat →  \nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc\noxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.\nZnO(s) + C(s) →  Zn(s) + CO(g)\nYou are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction\nexplained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds\nis also a reduction process.\nBesides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,\nsometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive\nmetals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nScience52\nagents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their\ncompounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with\naluminium powder, the following reaction takes place –\n3MnO2(s) + 4Al(s) →  3Mn(l) + 2Al2O3(s) + Heat\nCan you identify the substances that are getting oxidised\nand reduced?\nThese displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The\namount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced\nin the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3)\nwith aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked\nmachine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.\nFe2O3(s) + 2Al(s) →  2Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) + Heat\n3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the T op of the\nActivity Series\nThe metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium\nare obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals\nare deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,\nchlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The\nreactions are –\nAt cathode Na+ + e– → Na\nAt anode       2Cl– → Cl2 + 2e–\nSimilarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of\naluminium oxide.\n3.4.6 Refining of Metals\nThe metals produced by various reduction processes\ndescribed above are not very pure. They contain\nimpurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals.\nThe most widely used method for refining impure metals\nis electrolytic refining.\nElectrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Many metals, such as copper, zinc,\ntin, nickel, silver, gold, etc., are refined electrolytically. In\nthis process, the impure metal is made the anode and a\nthin strip of pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of\nthe metal salt is used as an electrolyte. The apparatus is\nset up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On passing the current\nthrough the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode\ndissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure\nFigure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11Figure 3.11\nThermit process for\njoining railway tracks\nFigure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12Figure 3.12\nElectr olytic r efining of copper .

It is, therefore, not suitable for making\njewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,\n22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is\nalloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver.\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wires together.\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,\ndissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled\nto room temperature.\nIron pillar at Delhi\nThe wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy\nThe iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more\nthan 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India.  They had\ndeveloped a process which prevented iron from rusting. For\nits quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists\nfrom all parts of the world. The iron pillar is 8 m high and\nweighs 6 tonnes (6000 kg).\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nMetals and Non-metals 55\nIn which cases will you find displacement reactions taking place?"

Different metals show different reactivities\ntowards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures.\nDo You Know?\nAnodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it\nresistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the\noxide layer thicker.  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode\nreacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer.  This oxide layer can\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.\nBut burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead.

At some places, minerals contain a very high\npercentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted\nfrom it. These minerals are called ores.\n3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\nYou have lear nt about the r eactivity series of metals. Having this\nknowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its\nore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some\nare found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of\nthe activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nScience50\nstate. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the\nfree state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as\ntheir sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series\n(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in\nnature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s\ncrust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that\nthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very\nreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\nThus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity.

The oxides of these\nmetals can be  reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\n(HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted\ninto mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury\non further heating.\n2HgS(s) + 3O (g) 2HgO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2\nHeat →  \n2HgO(s) 2Hg(l) + O (g) 2\nHeat →  \nSimilarly, copper which is found as Cu2S in nature can be obtained\nfrom its ore by just heating in air.\n2Cu S + 3O (g) 2Cu O(s) + 2SO (g)\n2Cu O + Cu S \n2 2 2 2\n2 2\nHeat\nHeat\n →   \n →    6Cu(s) + SO (g)2\n3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series\nThe metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead,\ncopper, are moderately reactive. These are usually present as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows –\nRoasting\n2ZnS(s) + 3O (g) 2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2\nHeat →   \nCalcination\nZnCO (s) ZnO(s) + CO (g)3 2\nHeat →  \nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc\noxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.\nZnO(s) + C(s) →  Zn(s) + CO(g)\nYou are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction\nexplained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds\nis also a reduction process.\nBesides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,\nsometimes displacement reactions can also be used.

The\namount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced\nin the molten state.

This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.\nFe2O3(s) + 2Al(s) →  2Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) + Heat\n3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the T op of the\nActivity Series\nThe metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium\nare obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals\nare deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,\nchlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The\nreactions are –\nAt cathode Na+ + e– → Na\nAt anode       2Cl– → Cl2 + 2e–\nSimilarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of\naluminium oxide.\n3.4.6 Refining of Metals\nThe metals produced by various reduction processes\ndescribed above are not very pure. They contain\nimpurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals.\nThe most widely used method for refining impure metals\nis electrolytic refining.\nElectrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Electrolytic Refining: Many metals, such as copper, zinc,\ntin, nickel, silver, gold, etc., are refined electrolytically. In\nthis process, the impure metal is made the anode and a\nthin strip of pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of\nthe metal salt is used as an electrolyte. The apparatus is\nset up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On passing the current\nthrough the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode\ndissolves into the electrolyte.

It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,\n22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is\nalloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver.\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wires together.\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,\ndissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled\nto room temperature.\nIron pillar at Delhi\nThe wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy\nThe iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more\nthan 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India.  They had\ndeveloped a process which prevented iron from rusting. For\nits quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists\nfrom all parts of the world.

Changes in the environment\naffect us and our activities change the environment around us. We have\nalready seen in Class IX how our activities pollute the environment. In\nthis chapter, we shall be looking at two of the environmental problems\nin detail, that is, depletion of the ozone layer and waste disposal.\n13.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted\nOzone (O3) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O 2,\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However , at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiation\n/square6Newspaper reports about pesticide levels in ready-made food items\nare often seen these days and some states have banned these\nproducts. Debate in groups the need for such bans.\n/square6What do you think would be the source of pesticides in these food\nitems? Could pesticides get into our bodies from this source through\nother food products too?\n/square6Discuss what methods could be applied to reduce our intake of\npesticides.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nOur Environment 213\nActivity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5\nActivity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4\nis highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin\ncancer in human beings.\nOzone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV\nradiation acting on oxygen (O 2) molecule. The higher energy UV\nradiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O2) into free oxygen (O)\natoms. These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form\nozone as shown—\nO O+O2\nUV → \nO O O2 3\nOzone)\n+ →\n(\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in\nthe 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire\nextinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at\n1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies\nto make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.\n/square6Collect waste material from your homes. This could include all\nthe waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,\nvegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),\nwaste paper, empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and\ntorn clothes and br oken footwear.\n/square6Bury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is no\nspace available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/\nflower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil.\n/square6Keep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals.\n/square6What are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods\nof time?\n/square6What are the materials which change their form and structure\nover time?\n/square6Of these materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest?\n/square6Find out from the library, internet or newspaper reports, which\nchemicals are responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer .\n/square6Find out if the regulations put in place to control the emission of\nthese chemicals have succeeded in reducing the damage to the\nozone layer. Has the size of the hole in the ozone layer changed in\nrecent years?\n13.2.2 Managing the Garbage we Produce\nIn our daily activities, we generate a lot of material that are thrown\naway. What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we\nthrow them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these\nquestions.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nScience214\nWe have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Processes’ that the food we eat is\ndigested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why\nthe same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are\nspecific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-down\nof a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we\ntry to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics\nwill not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes.\nThese materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and\npressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment,\nthese persist for a long time.\nSubstances that are broken down by biological processes are said\nto be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were\nbiodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner\nare said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert and\nsimply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various\nmembers of the eco-system.\nActivity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6\n/square6Use the library or internet to find out more about biodegradable\nand non-biodegradable substances.\n/square6How long are various non-biodegradable substances expected to\nlast in our environment?\n/square6These days, new types of plastics which are said to be biodegradable\nare available.

While O 2,\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However , at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun.

Even when we\nare not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a\nstate of order in our body. We also need materials from outside in order\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat.\nHow do living things get their food?\nThe general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water . These or ganisms, the autotr ophs, include gr\neen\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances.\nThese complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs.\nHeterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.\n5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition\nCarbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are\nfulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take\nin substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of\nenergy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water\nwhich is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and\nchlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.\nWe will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates\nwhich are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which\nserves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required\nby the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of\nthe energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form\nof glycogen.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nScience82\nLet us now see what actually happens during the process of\nphotosynthesis. The following events occur during this process –\nFigure 5.2Figure 5.2Figure 5.2Figure 5.2Figure 5.2\nVariegated leaf (a) before\nand (b) after starch test\nFigure 5.1Figure 5.1Figure 5.1Figure 5.1Figure 5.1\nCross-section of a leaf\nActivity 5.1Activity 5.1Activity 5.1Activity 5.1Activity 5.1\n/square6Take a potted plant with variegated leaves – for example, money plant\nor crotons.\n/square6Keep the plant in a dark room for three days so that all the starch\ngets used up.\n/square6Now keep the plant in sunlight for about six hours.\n/square6Pluck a leaf from the plant. Mark the green areas in it and trace them\non a sheet of paper .\n/square6Dip the leaf in boiling water for a few minutes.\n/square6After this, immerse it in a beaker containing alcohol.\n/square6Carefully place the above beaker in a water -bath and heat till the\nalcohol begins to boil.\n/square6What happens to the colour of the leaf? What is the colour of the\nsolution?\n/square6Now dip the leaf in a dilute solution of iodine for a few minutes.\n/square6Take out the leaf and rinse off the iodine solution.\n/square6Observe the colour of the leaf and compare this with the tracing of\nthe leaf done in the beginning (Fig. 5.2).\n/square6What can you conclude about the presence of starch in various areas\nof the leaf?\n(i) Absorption of light energy by\nchlorophyll.\n(ii) Conversion of light energy to chemical\nenergy and splitting of water molecules\ninto hydrogen and oxygen.\n(iii) Reduction of carbon dioxide to\ncarbohydrates.\nThese steps need not take place one after\nthe other immediately. For example, desert\nplants take up carbon dioxide at night and\nprepare an intermediate which is acted upon\nby the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll\nduring the day.\nLet us see how each of the components of\nthe above reaction are necessary for\nphotosynthesis.\nIf you carefully observe a cross-section of a\nleaf under the microscope (shown in Fig. 5.1),\nyou will notice that some cells contain green\ndots. These green dots are cell organelles called\nchloroplasts which contain chlorophyll. Let us\ndo an activity which demonstrates that\nchlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nLife Processes 83\nNow, let us study how the plant\nobtains carbon dioxide. In Class IX,\nwe had talked about stomata (Fig. 5.3)\nwhich are tiny pores present on the\nsurface of the leaves. Massive amounts\nof gaseous exchange takes place in the\nleaves through these pores for the\npurpose of photosynthesis. But it is\nimportant to note here that exchange\nof gases occurs across the surface of\nstems, roots and leaves as well. Since\nlarge amounts of water can also be lost\nthrough these stomata, the plant\ncloses these pores when it does not\nneed carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the\npore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water\nflows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore\ncloses if the guard cells shrink.\n/square6Take two healthy potted plants\nwhich are nearly the same size.\n/square6Keep them in a dark room for\nthree days.\n/square6Now place each plant on\nseparate glass plates. Place a\nwatch-glass containing potassium\nhydroxide by the side of one of\nthe plants.

But they also need other raw materials for building their\nbody. Water used in photosynthesis is taken up fr om the soil by the\nroots in terrestrial plants. Other materials like nitrogen, phosphorus,\niron and magnesium are taken up from the soil. Nitrogen is an essential\nelement used in the synthesis of proteins and other compounds. This is\nFigure 5.4 Experimental set-up (a) with potassium\nhydroxide (b) without potassium hydroxide\n(a) (b)\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nScience84\ntaken up in the form of inorganic nitrates or nitrites. Or it is taken up as\norganic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from\natmospheric nitrogen.\n5.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition\nEach organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it.\nExamples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or\nanimals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of or ganisms like cuscuta (amar -bel), ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms.\n5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?\nSince the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food\nmay be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the\norganism increases, different parts become specialised to perform\ndifferent functions. For example, \nAmoeba takes in food using\ntemporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over\nthe food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 5.5). Inside the food-\nvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones\nwhich then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested\nmaterial is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In\nParamoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a\ndefinite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved\nto this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface\nof the cell.\n5.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings\nThe alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth\nto the anus. In Fig. 5.6, we can see that the tube has different parts.\nVarious regions are specialised to per form different functions. What\nhappens to the food once it enters our body? W e shall discuss this\nprocess here.\nFigure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5\nNutrition in Amoeba\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nLife Processes 85\nActivity 5.3Activity 5.3Activity 5.3Activity 5.3Activity 5.3\n/square6Take 1 mL starch solution (1%) in two test tubes (A and B).\n/square6Add 1 mL saliva to test tube A and leave both test tubes undisturbed\nfor 20-30 minutes.\n/square6Now add a few drops of dilute iodine solution to the test tubes.\n/square6In which test tube do you observe a colour change?\n/square6What does this indicate about the presence or absence of starch\nin the two test tubes?\n/square6What does this tell us about the action of saliva on starch?\nWe eat various types of food which has to pass through the same\ndigestive tract. Naturally the food has to be processed to generate\nparticles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by\ncrushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the\nfood is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something\nwe like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water, but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary\ncanal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the\nhelp of biological catalysts called\nenzymes. The saliva contains an\nenzyme called salivary amylase that\nbreaks down starch which is a complex\nmolecule to give simple sugar. The food\nis mixed thoroughly with saliva and\nmoved around the mouth while\nchewing by the muscular tongue.\nIt is necessary to move the food in\na regulated manner along the digestive\ntube so that it can be processed\nproperly in each part. The lining of\ncanal has muscles that contract\nrhythmically in order to push the food\nforward. These peristaltic movements\noccur all along the gut.\nFrom the mouth, the food is taken\nto the stomach through the food-pipe\nor oesophagus. The stomach is a large\norgan which expands when food\nenters it. The muscular walls of the\nstomach help in mixing the food\nthoroughly with more digestive juices.\nThe digestion in stomach is taken\ncare of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These\nrelease hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin,\nand mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which\nfacilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you\nthink is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the\nstomach fr om the action of the acid under nor mal conditions. W e\nFigure 5.6Figure 5.6Figure 5.6Figure 5.6Figure 5.6  Human alimentary canal\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nScience86\nhave often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related\nto what has been discussed above?\nThe exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle\nwhich releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier\nto digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.\nThe small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of\ncarbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.\nBile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.\nFats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into\nsmaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar\nto the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in\nChapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains\nenzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down\nemulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which\nsecrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the\nproteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats\ninto fatty acids and glycerol.\nDigested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner\nlining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called\nvilli which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly\nsupplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and\nevery cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building\nup new tissues and the repair of old tissues.\nThe unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall\nabsorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed\nfrom the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated\nby the anal sphincter.\nMore to Know!\nDental caries\nDental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins\nwhen bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel.\nMasses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental\nplaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers\nthe teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria\nproduce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing\ninflammation and infection.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nLife Processes 87\n5.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR5.3 RESPIR AAA AATION TIONTION TIONTION\nActivity 5.4Activity 5.4Activity 5.4Activity 5.4Activity 5.4\n/square6Take some freshly prepared lime\nwater in a test tube.\n/square6Blow air through this lime water .\n/square6Note how long it takes for the lime\nwater to turn milky.\n/square6Use a syringe or pichkari  to pass air\nthrough some fresh lime water\ntaken in another test tube (Fig. 5.7).\n/square6Note how long it takes for this lime\nwater to turn milky.\n/square6What does this tell us about the\namount of carbon dioxide in the air\nthat we breathe out?"

The\nfood material taken in during the process of nutrition is used in cells to\nprovide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in\ndifferent ways – some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely\ninto carbon dioxide and water, some use other pathways that do not\ninvolve oxygen (Fig. 5.8). In all cases, the first step is the break-down of\nglucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called\npyruvate. This pr ocess takes place in the cytoplasm. Further , the\npyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process\ntakes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place\nin the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Break-\ndown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria. This\nFigure 5.7Figure 5.7Figure 5.7Figure 5.7Figure 5.7\n(a) Air being passed into lime water with a pichkari/\nsyringe, (b) air being exhaled into lime water\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nScience88\nprocess breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three\nmolecules of carbon dioxide. The other pr oduct is water . Since this\nprocess takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic\nrespiration. The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater\nthan in the anaerobic process. Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen\nin our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is\ntaken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a\nthree-carbon molecule. This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during\nsudden activity causes cramps.\nFigure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8  Break-down of glucose by various pathways\nThe energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used\nto synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other\nactivities in the cell. In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise\nto a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions\ntaking place in the cell.\nATP\nATP is the energy currency for most cellular processes. The energy released during\nthe process of respiration is used to make an ATP molecule from ADP and inorganic\nphosphate.\nEndothermic processes in the cell then use this ATP to drive the reactions. When the\nterminal phosphate linkage in A\nTP is broken using water, the energy equivalent to\n30.5 kJ/mol is released.\nThink of how a battery can provide energy for many different kinds of uses. It can be\nused to obtain mechanical energy, light energy, electrical energy and so on. Similarly,\nATP can be used in the cells for the contraction of muscles, protein synthesis,\nconduction of nervous impulses and many other activities.\nSince the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic\norganisms need to ensure that there is sufficient intake of oxygen. We\nhave seen that plants exchange gases through stomata, and the large\ninter-cellular spaces ensure that all cells are in contact with air. Carbon\ndioxide and oxygen are exchanged by diffusion here. They can go into\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nLife Processes 89\ncells, or away from them and out into the air. The direction of diffusion\ndepends upon the environmental conditions and the requirements of\nthe plant. At night, when there is no photosynthesis occurring, CO 2\nelimination is the major exchange activity going on. During the day,\nCO2 generated during respiration is used up for photosynthesis, hence\nthere is no CO2 release. Instead, oxygen release is the major event at\nthis time.\nAnimals have evolved different organs for the uptake of oxygen\nfrom the environment and for getting rid of the carbon dioxide\nproduced. Terrestrial animals can breathe the oxygen in the\natmosphere, but animals that live in water need to use the oxygen\ndissolved in water.\nActivity 5.6Activity 5.6Activity 5.6Activity 5.6Activity 5.6\n/square6Observe fish in an aquarium. They open and close their mouths\nand the gill-slits (or the operculum which covers the gill-slits)\nbehind their eyes also open and close. Are the timings of the\nopening and closing of the mouth and gill-slits coordinated in some\nmanner?\n/square6Count the number of times the fish opens and closes its mouth in\na minute.\n/square6Compare this to the number of times you breathe in and out in a\nminute.\nSince the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared\nto the amount of oxygen in the air, the rate of br\neathing in aquatic\norganisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms.\nFishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the\ngills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood.\nTerrestrial organisms use the oxygen in the atmosphere for\nrespiration. This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in\ndifferent animals. All these organs have a structure that increases\nthe surface area which is in contact with the oxygen-rich\natmosphere. Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nhas to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine\nand delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed\nwithin the body, so there have to be passages that will take air\nto this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air\nin and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed.\nIn human beings (Fig. 5.9), air is taken into the body through\nthe nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by\nfine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with\nmucus which helps in this process. From here, the air passes\nthrough the throat and into the lungs. Rings of cartilage are\npresent in the throat. These ensure that the air-passage does\nnot collapse.\nUsing tobacco directly or\nany product of tobacco in\nthe form of cigar, cigarettes,\nbidis, hookah, gutkha\n, etc.,\nis harmful. Use of tobacco\nmost commonly affects the\ntongue, lungs, heart and\nliver. Smokeless tobacco is\nalso a major risk factor for\nheart attacks, strokes,\npulmonary diseases and\nseveral forms of cancers.\nThere is a high incidence of\noral cancer in India due to\nthe chewing of tobacco in\nthe form of gutkha. Stay\nhealthy; just say NO to\ntobacco and its products!\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nScience90\nWithin the lungs, the passage divides into smaller and smaller\ntubes which finally terminate in balloon-like structures which\nare called alveoli (singular–alveolus). The alveoli provide a surface\nwhere the exchange of gases can take place. The walls of the alveoli\ncontain an extensive network of blood-vessels. As we have seen\nin earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten\nour diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result.\nBecause of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded\nalveoli. The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body\nfor release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is\ntaken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported\nto all the cells in the body. During the breathing cycle, when air is\ntaken in and let out, the lungs always contain a residual volume\nof air so that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed\nand for the carbon dioxide to be released.\nWhen the body size of animals is large,  the diffusion pressure\nalone cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body.\nInstead, respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the\nlungs and carry it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before\nreleasing it. In human beings, the respiratory pigment is\nhaemoglobin which has a very high affinity for oxygen. This pigment\nis present in the red blood corpuscles. Carbon dioxide is more\nsoluble in water than oxygen is and hence is mostly transported in\nthe dissolved form in our blood.\nFigure 5.9Figure 5.9Figure 5.9Figure 5.9Figure 5.9  Human respiratory system\nDo You Know?\nSmoking is injurious to\nhealth.\nLung cancer is one of\ncommon causes of\ndeaths in the world.

In Class IX, we learnt about blood\nbeing a fluid connective tissue. Blood consists of a fluid medium called\nplasma in which the cells are suspended. Plasma transports food, carbon\ndioxide and nitrogenous wastes in dissolved form. Oxygen is carried by\nthe red blood corpuscles. Many other substances like salts, are also\ntransported by the blood. We thus need a pumping organ to push blood\naround the body, a network of tubes to reach all the tissues and a system\nin place to ensure that this network can be repaired if damaged.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nScience92\nThe heart is a muscular organ which is\nas big as our fist (Fig. 5.10). Because\nboth oxygen and carbon dioxide have to\nbe transported by the blood, the heart\nhas different chambers to prevent the\noxygen-rich blood from mixing with the\nblood containing carbon dioxide. The\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach\nthe lungs for the carbon dioxide to be\nremoved, and the oxygenated blood from\nthe lungs has to be brought back to the\nheart. This oxygen-rich blood is then\npumped to the rest of the body.\nWe can follow this pr ocess step by\nstep (Fig. 5.11). Oxygen-rich blood from\nthe lungs comes to the thin-walled upper\nchamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes\nwhen it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber,\nthe left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the\nmuscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to\nthe body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper\nchamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium\ncontracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates.\nThis transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the\nlungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various\norgans, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. Valves ensure\nthat blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.\nOxygen enters the blood in the lungs\nThe separation of the right side and the left side of\nthe heart is useful to keep oxygenated and de-\noxygenated blood from mixing. Such separation\nallows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the\nbody. This is useful in animals that have high\nenergy needs, such as birds and mammals, which\nconstantly use energy to maintain their body\ntemperature. In animals that do not use energy\nfor this purpose, the body temperature depends\non the temperature in the environment. Such\nanimals, like amphibians or  many reptiles have\nthree-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing\nof the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood\nstreams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two\nchambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped\nto the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly\nto the rest of the body. Thus, blood goes only once\nthrough the heart in the fish during one cycle of\npassage through the body. On the other hand, it goes through the heart\ntwice during each cycle in other vertebrates. This is known as double\ncirculation.\nOur pump — the heart\nFigure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10\nSchematic sectional\nview of the human heart\nFigure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11\nSchematic representation of transport and exchange\nof oxygen and carbon dioxide\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nLife Processes 93\nMore to Know!\nBlood pressure is measured with an instrument called sphygmomanometer. High\nblood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of\narterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow. It can lead to the rupture\nof an artery and internal bleeding.\nBlood pressure\nThe force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This\npressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the\nartery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure\nin artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal\nsystolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg.\nThe tubes – blood vessels\nArteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various\norgans of the body. Since the blood emerges from the heart under high\npressure, the arteries have thick, elastic walls. Veins collect the blood\nfrom different organs and bring it back to the heart. They do not need\nthick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure, instead they\nhave valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction.\nOn reaching an organ or tissue, the artery divides into smaller and\nsmaller vessels to bring the blood in contact with all the individual cells.\nThe smallest vessels have walls which are one-cell thick and are called\ncapillaries. Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding\ncells takes place across this thin wall. The capillaries then join together\nto form veins that convey the blood away from the organ or tissue.\nMaintenance by platelets\nWhat happens if this system of tubes develops a leak? Think about\nsituations when we are injured and start bleeding. Naturally the loss of\nblood from the system has to be minimised. In addition, leakage would\nlead to a loss of pressure which would reduce the efficiency of the\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nScience94\npumping system. To avoid this, the blood has platelet cells which circulate\naround the body and plug these leaks by helping to clot the blood at\nthese points of injury.\nLymph\nThere is another type of fluid also involved in transportation. This is\ncalled lymph or tissue fluid. Through the pores present in the walls of\ncapillaries some amount of plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into\nintercellular spaces in the tissues to form the tissue fluid or lymph. It is\nsimilar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein.\nLymph drains into lymphatic capillaries fr\nom the intercellular spaces,\nwhich join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins.\nLymph carries digested and absorbed fat from intestine and drains excess\nfluid from extra cellular space back into the blood.\n5.4.2 Transportation in Plants\nWe have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such\nas CO2 and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing\norgans, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots.\nIf the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations.\nEnergy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems\nhave to operate, however, can be very large in plants such as very tall\ntrees.\nPlant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw\nmaterials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as\nindependently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem  moves water\nand minerals obtained from the soil. The other , phloem transports\nproducts of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised\nto other parts of the plant. We have studied the structure of these tissues\nin detail in Class IX.\nTransport of water\nIn xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are\ninterconnected to for m a continuous system of water -conducting\nchannels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact\nwith the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the\nconcentration of these ions between the root and the soil. Water, therefore,\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nLife Processes 95\nmoves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference. This means\nthat there is steady movement of water into root xylem, creating a column\nof water that is steadily pushed upwards.\nHowever, this pressure by itself is unlikely to be enough to move\nwater over the heights that we commonly see in plants. Plants use another\nstrategy to move water in the xylem upwards to the highest points of the\nplant body.\nActivity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8\n/square6Take two small pots of approximately the same size and having\nthe same amount of soil. One should have a plant in it. Place a\nstick of the same height as the plant in the other pot.\n/square6Cover the soil in both pots with a plastic sheet so that moisture\ncannot escape by evaporation.\n/square6Cover both sets, one with the plant and the other with the stick,\nwith plastic sheets and place in bright sunlight for half an hour .\n/square6Do you observe any difference in the two cases?\nProvided that the plant has an adequate\nsupply of water, the water which is lost thr\nough the\nstomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels\nin the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from\nthe cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water\nfrom the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the\nform of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is\nknown as transpiration.\nThus, transpiration helps in the absorption and\nupward movement of water and minerals dissolved\nin it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in\ntemperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in\ntransport of water is more important at night. During\nthe day when the stomata are open, the transpiration\npull becomes the major driving force in the movement\nof water in the xylem.\nTransport of food and other substances\nSo far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants.\nNow let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly\nphotosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other\nparts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis\nis called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue\nknown as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances. These substances are\nespecially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and\nto growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes\nplace in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both\nin upward and downward directions.\nUnlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple\nphysical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising\nFigure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12\nMovement of water during transpiration in a tree\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nScience96\nenergy. Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using\nenergy from ATP. This incr eases the osmotic pr essure of the tissue\ncausing water to move into it. This pressure moves the material in the\nphloem to tissues which have less pressure. This allows the phloem to\nmove material according to the plant’s needs. For example, in the spring,\nsugar stored in root or stem tissue would be transported to the buds\nwhich need energy to grow.\nQUESTIONS\n?"

Other metabolic activities\ngenerate nitrogenous materials which need to be removed. The biological\nprocess involved in the removal of these harmful metabolic wastes from\nthe body is called excretion. Different organisms use varied strategies to\ndo this. Many unicellular organisms remove these wastes by simple\ndiffusion from the body surface into the surrounding\nwater. As we have seen in other processes, complex\nmulti-cellular organisms use specialised organs to\nperform the same function.\n5.5.1 Excretion in Human Beings\nThe excretory system of human beings (Fig. 5.13)\nincludes a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary\nbladder and a urethra. Kidneys are located in the\nabdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine\nproduced in the kidneys passes through the ureters\ninto the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is\nreleased through the urethra.\nHow is urine produced? The purpose of making\nurine is to filter out waste products from the blood.\nJust as CO2 is removed from the blood in the lungs,\nnitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are\nremoved from blood in the kidneys. It is then no\nsurprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys,\nFigure 5.13\nExcretory system in human beings\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nLife Processes 97\nlike in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood\ncapillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is\nassociated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube\ncalled Bowman’s capsule that collects the filtrate\n (Fig. 5.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these\nfiltration units called nephrons packed close together.\nSome substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,\namino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are\nselectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube.\nThe amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much\nexcess water there is in the body, and on how much of\ndissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming\nin each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter,\nwhich connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder.\nUrine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure\nof the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out\nthrough the urethra. The bladder is muscular, so it is\nunder nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere.\nAs a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.\nMore to Know!\nArtificial kidney (Hemodialysis)\nKidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted\nblood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of\npoisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney\nfailure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove\nnitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.\nArtificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended\nin a tank filled with dialysing fluid.\nThis fluid has the same osmotic\npressure as blood, except that it is\ndevoid of nitrogenous wastes. The\npatient’s blood is passed through\nthese tubes. During this passage,\nthe waste products from the blood\npass into dialysing fluid by diffusion.\nThe purified blood is pumped back\ninto the patient. This is similar to the\nfunction of the kidney, but it is\ndifferent since there is no re-\nabsorption involved. Normally, in a\nhealthy adult, the initial filtrate in the\nkidneys is about 180 L daily.\nHowever , the volume actually\nexcreted is only a litre or two a day,\nbecause the remaining filtrate is re-\nabsorbed in the kidney tubules.\nFigure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14\nStructure of a nephron\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 20 ---\nScience98\n5.5.2 Excretion in Plants\nPlants use completely different\nstrategies for excretion than those\nof animals. Oxygen itself can be\nthought of as a waste product\ngenerated during photosynthesis!\nWe have discussed earlier how\nplants deal with oxygen as well as\nCO2. They can get rid of excess water\nby transpiration. For other wastes,\nplants use the fact that many of\ntheir tissues consist of dead cells,\nand that they can even lose some\nparts such as leaves. Many plant\nwaste products are stored in\ncellular vacuoles. Waste pr\noducts\nmay be stored in leaves that fall off.\nOther waste products are stored as\nresins and gums, especially in old\nxylem. Plants also excrete some\nwaste substances into the soil\naround them.\nWhat you have learnt\n/square6Movement of various types can be taken as an indication of life.\n/square6Maintenance of life requires processes like nutrition, respiration, transport of\nmaterials within the body and excretion of waste products.\n/square6Autotrophic nutrition involves the intake of simple inorganic materials from the\nenvironment and using an external energy source like the Sun to synthesise complex\nhigh-energy organic material.\n/square6Heterotrophic nutrition involves the intake of complex material prepared by other\norganisms.\n/square6In human beings, the food eaten is broken down by various steps along the\nalimentary canal and the digested food is absorbed in the small intestine to be sent\nto all cells in the body.\nThink it over!\nOrgan donation\nOrgan donation is a generous act of donating an\norgan to a person who suffers from non-function of\norgan(s). Donation of an organ may be done by the\nconsent of the donor and his/her family. Anyone\nregardless of age or gender can become an organ\nand tissue donor. Organ transplants can save or\ntransform the life of a person. Transplantation is\nrequired because recipient’s organ has been\ndamaged or has failed by disease or injury. In organ\ntransplantation the organ is surgically removed\nfrom one person (organ donor) and transplanted to\nanother person (the recipient). Common\ntransplantations include corneas, kidneys, heart,\nliver, pancreas, lungs, intestines and bone marrow.\nMost organ and tissue donations occur just after\nthe donor has died or when the doctor declares a\nperson brain dead. But some organs such as\nkidney, part of a liver, lung, etc., and tissues can be\ndonated while the donor is alive.\n?\nQUESTIONS"

Even when we\nare not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a\nstate of order in our body. We also need materials from outside in order\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat.\nHow do living things get their food?\nThe general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water . These or ganisms, the autotr ophs, include gr\neen\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances.\nThese complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs.\nHeterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.\n5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition\nCarbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are\nfulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take\nin substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of\nenergy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water\nwhich is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and\nchlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.\nWe will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates\nwhich are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which\nserves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required\nby the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of\nthe energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form\nof glycogen.\n2024-25",

Or it is taken up as\norganic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from\natmospheric nitrogen.\n5.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition\nEach organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it.\nExamples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or\nanimals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of or ganisms like cuscuta (amar -bel), ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms.\n5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?\nSince the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food\nmay be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the\norganism increases, different parts become specialised to perform\ndifferent functions. For example, \nAmoeba takes in food using\ntemporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over\nthe food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 5.5). Inside the food-\nvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones\nwhich then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested\nmaterial is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In\nParamoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a\ndefinite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved\nto this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface\nof the cell.\n5.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings\nThe alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth\nto the anus. In Fig. 5.6, we can see that the tube has different parts.\nVarious regions are specialised to per form different functions. What\nhappens to the food once it enters our body? W e shall discuss this\nprocess here.\nFigure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5Figure 5.5\nNutrition in Amoeba\n2024-25",

Naturally the food has to be processed to generate\nparticles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by\ncrushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the\nfood is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something\nwe like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water, but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary\ncanal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the\nhelp of biological catalysts called\nenzymes. The saliva contains an\nenzyme called salivary amylase that\nbreaks down starch which is a complex\nmolecule to give simple sugar. The food\nis mixed thoroughly with saliva and\nmoved around the mouth while\nchewing by the muscular tongue.\nIt is necessary to move the food in\na regulated manner along the digestive\ntube so that it can be processed\nproperly in each part. The lining of\ncanal has muscles that contract\nrhythmically in order to push the food\nforward. These peristaltic movements\noccur all along the gut.\nFrom the mouth, the food is taken\nto the stomach through the food-pipe\nor oesophagus. The stomach is a large\norgan which expands when food\nenters it. The muscular walls of the\nstomach help in mixing the food\nthoroughly with more digestive juices.\nThe digestion in stomach is taken\ncare of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These\nrelease hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin,\nand mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which\nfacilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you\nthink is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the\nstomach fr om the action of the acid under nor mal conditions.

Can this be related\nto what has been discussed above?\nThe exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle\nwhich releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier\nto digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.\nThe small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of\ncarbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.\nBile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.\nFats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into\nsmaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar\nto the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in\nChapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains\nenzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down\nemulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which\nsecrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the\nproteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats\ninto fatty acids and glycerol.\nDigested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner\nlining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called\nvilli which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly\nsupplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and\nevery cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building\nup new tissues and the repair of old tissues.\nThe unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall\nabsorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed\nfrom the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated\nby the anal sphincter.\nMore to Know!\nDental caries\nDental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins\nwhen bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel.\nMasses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental\nplaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers\nthe teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria\nproduce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing\ninflammation and infection.\n2024-25",

Diverse organisms do this in\ndifferent ways – some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely\ninto carbon dioxide and water, some use other pathways that do not\ninvolve oxygen (Fig. 5.8). In all cases, the first step is the break-down of\nglucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called\npyruvate. This pr ocess takes place in the cytoplasm. Further , the\npyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process\ntakes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place\nin the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Break-\ndown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria.

Since this\nprocess takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic\nrespiration. The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater\nthan in the anaerobic process. Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen\nin our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is\ntaken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a\nthree-carbon molecule. This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during\nsudden activity causes cramps.\nFigure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8  Break-down of glucose by various pathways\nThe energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used\nto synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other\nactivities in the cell. In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise\nto a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions\ntaking place in the cell.\nATP\nATP is the energy currency for most cellular processes. The energy released during\nthe process of respiration is used to make an ATP molecule from ADP and inorganic\nphosphate.\nEndothermic processes in the cell then use this ATP to drive the reactions. When the\nterminal phosphate linkage in A\nTP is broken using water, the energy equivalent to\n30.5 kJ/mol is released.\nThink of how a battery can provide energy for many different kinds of uses. It can be\nused to obtain mechanical energy, light energy, electrical energy and so on. Similarly,\nATP can be used in the cells for the contraction of muscles, protein synthesis,\nconduction of nervous impulses and many other activities.\nSince the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic\norganisms need to ensure that there is sufficient intake of oxygen.

At night, when there is no photosynthesis occurring, CO 2\nelimination is the major exchange activity going on. During the day,\nCO2 generated during respiration is used up for photosynthesis, hence\nthere is no CO2 release. Instead, oxygen release is the major event at\nthis time.\nAnimals have evolved different organs for the uptake of oxygen\nfrom the environment and for getting rid of the carbon dioxide\nproduced.

This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in\ndifferent animals. All these organs have a structure that increases\nthe surface area which is in contact with the oxygen-rich\natmosphere. Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nhas to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine\nand delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed\nwithin the body, so there have to be passages that will take air\nto this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air\nin and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed.\nIn human beings (Fig. 5.9), air is taken into the body through\nthe nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by\nfine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with\nmucus which helps in this process. From here, the air passes\nthrough the throat and into the lungs. Rings of cartilage are\npresent in the throat.

The alveoli provide a surface\nwhere the exchange of gases can take place. The walls of the alveoli\ncontain an extensive network of blood-vessels. As we have seen\nin earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten\nour diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result.\nBecause of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded\nalveoli. The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body\nfor release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is\ntaken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported\nto all the cells in the body.

The\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach\nthe lungs for the carbon dioxide to be\nremoved, and the oxygenated blood from\nthe lungs has to be brought back to the\nheart. This oxygen-rich blood is then\npumped to the rest of the body.\nWe can follow this pr ocess step by\nstep (Fig. 5.11). Oxygen-rich blood from\nthe lungs comes to the thin-walled upper\nchamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes\nwhen it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber,\nthe left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the\nmuscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to\nthe body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper\nchamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium\ncontracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates.\nThis transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the\nlungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various\norgans, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. Valves ensure\nthat blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.\nOxygen enters the blood in the lungs\nThe separation of the right side and the left side of\nthe heart is useful to keep oxygenated and de-\noxygenated blood from mixing. Such separation\nallows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the\nbody. This is useful in animals that have high\nenergy needs, such as birds and mammals, which\nconstantly use energy to maintain their body\ntemperature. In animals that do not use energy\nfor this purpose, the body temperature depends\non the temperature in the environment. Such\nanimals, like amphibians or  many reptiles have\nthree-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing\nof the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood\nstreams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two\nchambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped\nto the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly\nto the rest of the body. Thus, blood goes only once\nthrough the heart in the fish during one cycle of\npassage through the body. On the other hand, it goes through the heart\ntwice during each cycle in other vertebrates. This is known as double\ncirculation.\nOur pump — the heart\nFigure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10Figure 5.10\nSchematic sectional\nview of the human heart\nFigure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11Figure 5.11\nSchematic representation of transport and exchange\nof oxygen and carbon dioxide\n2024-25",

High\nblood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of\narterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow. It can lead to the rupture\nof an artery and internal bleeding.\nBlood pressure\nThe force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This\npressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the\nartery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure\nin artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal\nsystolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg.\nThe tubes – blood vessels\nArteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various\norgans of the body. Since the blood emerges from the heart under high\npressure, the arteries have thick, elastic walls. Veins collect the blood\nfrom different organs and bring it back to the heart. They do not need\nthick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure, instead they\nhave valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction.\nOn reaching an organ or tissue, the artery divides into smaller and\nsmaller vessels to bring the blood in contact with all the individual cells.\nThe smallest vessels have walls which are one-cell thick and are called\ncapillaries. Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding\ncells takes place across this thin wall. The capillaries then join together\nto form veins that convey the blood away from the organ or tissue.\nMaintenance by platelets\nWhat happens if this system of tubes develops a leak? Think about\nsituations when we are injured and start bleeding. Naturally the loss of\nblood from the system has to be minimised.

To avoid this, the blood has platelet cells which circulate\naround the body and plug these leaks by helping to clot the blood at\nthese points of injury.\nLymph\nThere is another type of fluid also involved in transportation. This is\ncalled lymph or tissue fluid. Through the pores present in the walls of\ncapillaries some amount of plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into\nintercellular spaces in the tissues to form the tissue fluid or lymph. It is\nsimilar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein.\nLymph drains into lymphatic capillaries fr\nom the intercellular spaces,\nwhich join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins.\nLymph carries digested and absorbed fat from intestine and drains excess\nfluid from extra cellular space back into the blood.\n5.4.2 Transportation in Plants\nWe have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such\nas CO2 and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing\norgans, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots.\nIf the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations.\nEnergy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems\nhave to operate, however, can be very large in plants such as very tall\ntrees.\nPlant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw\nmaterials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as\nindependently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem  moves water\nand minerals obtained from the soil. The other , phloem transports\nproducts of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised\nto other parts of the plant. We have studied the structure of these tissues\nin detail in Class IX.\nTransport of water\nIn xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are\ninterconnected to for m a continuous system of water -conducting\nchannels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact\nwith the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the\nconcentration of these ions between the root and the soil. Water, therefore,\n2024-25",

This means\nthat there is steady movement of water into root xylem, creating a column\nof water that is steadily pushed upwards.\nHowever, this pressure by itself is unlikely to be enough to move\nwater over the heights that we commonly see in plants. Plants use another\nstrategy to move water in the xylem upwards to the highest points of the\nplant body.\nActivity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8Activity 5.8\n/square6Take two small pots of approximately the same size and having\nthe same amount of soil.

In fact, evaporation of water molecules from\nthe cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water\nfrom the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the\nform of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is\nknown as transpiration.\nThus, transpiration helps in the absorption and\nupward movement of water and minerals dissolved\nin it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in\ntemperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in\ntransport of water is more important at night. During\nthe day when the stomata are open, the transpiration\npull becomes the major driving force in the movement\nof water in the xylem.\nTransport of food and other substances\nSo far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants.\nNow let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly\nphotosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other\nparts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis\nis called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue\nknown as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances. These substances are\nespecially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and\nto growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes\nplace in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both\nin upward and downward directions.\nUnlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple\nphysical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising\nFigure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12\nMovement of water during transpiration in a tree\n2024-25",

The biological\nprocess involved in the removal of these harmful metabolic wastes from\nthe body is called excretion. Different organisms use varied strategies to\ndo this. Many unicellular organisms remove these wastes by simple\ndiffusion from the body surface into the surrounding\nwater.

Each capillary cluster in the kidney is\nassociated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube\ncalled Bowman’s capsule that collects the filtrate\n (Fig. 5.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these\nfiltration units called nephrons packed close together.\nSome substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,\namino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are\nselectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube.\nThe amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much\nexcess water there is in the body, and on how much of\ndissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming\nin each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter,\nwhich connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder.\nUrine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure\nof the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out\nthrough the urethra. The bladder is muscular, so it is\nunder nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere.\nAs a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.\nMore to Know!\nArtificial kidney (Hemodialysis)\nKidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted\nblood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of\npoisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney\nfailure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove\nnitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.\nArtificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended\nin a tank filled with dialysing fluid.\nThis fluid has the same osmotic\npressure as blood, except that it is\ndevoid of nitrogenous wastes. The\npatient’s blood is passed through\nthese tubes. During this passage,\nthe waste products from the blood\npass into dialysing fluid by diffusion.\nThe purified blood is pumped back\ninto the patient. This is similar to the\nfunction of the kidney, but it is\ndifferent since there is no re-\nabsorption involved. Normally, in a\nhealthy adult, the initial filtrate in the\nkidneys is about 180 L daily.\nHowever , the volume actually\nexcreted is only a litre or two a day,\nbecause the remaining filtrate is re-\nabsorbed in the kidney tubules.\nFigure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14\nStructure of a nephron\n2024-25",

For parallel refracting surfaces, as in a glass slab, the emergent ray\nis parallel to the incident ray.  However, it is slightly displaced laterally.\nHow would light get refracted through a transparent prism? Consider a\ntriangular glass prism. It has two triangular bases and three rectangular\nlateral surfaces. These surfaces are inclined to each other. The angle\nbetween its two lateral faces is called the angle of the prism. Let us now\ndo an activity to study the refraction of light through a triangular glass\nprism.\n/square6Eyes must be removed within 4-6 hours after death. Inform the nearest eye bank\nimmediately.\n/square6The eye bank team will remove the eyes at the home of the deceased or at a hospital.\n/square6Eye removal takes only 10-15 minutes. It is a simple process and does not lead to\nany disfigurement.\n/square6Persons who were infected with or died because of AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, rabies,\nacute leukaemia, tetanus, cholera, meningitis or encephalitis cannot donate eyes.\nAn eye bank collects, evaluates and distributes the donated eyes. All eyes donated are\nevaluated using strict medical standards. Those donated eyes found unsuitable for\ntransplantation are used for valuable research and medical education. The identities\nof both the donor and the recipient remain confidential.\nOne pair of eyes gives vision to up to FOUR CORNEAL BLIND PEOPLE.\nActivity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1\n/square6Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\n/square6Place a glass prism on it in such a way that it rests on its triangular\nbase. Trace the outline of the prism using a pencil.\n/square6Draw a straight line PE inclined to one of the refracting surfaces,\nsay AB, of the prism.\n/square6Fix two pins, say at points P and Q, on the line PE as shown in\nFig. 10.4.\n/square6Look for the images of the pins, fixed at P and Q, through the\nother face AC.\n/square6Fix two more pins, at points R and S, such that the pins at R and\nS and the images of the pins at P and Q lie on the same straight\nline.\n/square6Remove the pins and the glass prism.\n/square6The line PE meets the boundary of the prism at point E\n(see Fig. 10.4). Similarly, join and produce the points R and S.  Let\nthese lines meet the boundary of the prism at E and F, respectively.\nJoin E and F.\n/square6Draw perpendiculars to the refracting surfaces AB and AC of the\nprism at points E and F , respectively.\n/square6Mark the angle of incidence ( ∠ i), the angle of refraction ( ∠ r) and\nthe angle of emergence ( ∠ e) as shown in Fig. 10.4.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nScience166\nActivity 10.2Activity 10.2Activity 10.2Activity 10.2Activity 10.2\n/square6Take a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrow\nslit in its middle.\n/square6Allow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit. This gives a narrow beam\nof white light.\n/square6Now, take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on\none of its faces as shown in Fig. 10.5.\n/square6Turn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears\non a nearby screen.\n/square6What do you observe? Y ou will find a beautiful band of colours.\nWhy does this happen?\nHere PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted ray and FS is the\nemergent ray. You may note that a ray of light is entering fr\nom air to\nglass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards\nthe normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from\nglass to air. Hence it has bent away from normal. Compare the angle of\nincidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the\nprism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?\nThe peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an\nangle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of\ndeviation. In this case ∠ D is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle of\ndeviation in the above activity and measure it.\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL ASS PRISM ASS PRISMASS PRISM ASS PRISMASS PRISM\nYou must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow.\nHow could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the\nrainbow? Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to the\nrefraction of light through a prism. The inclined refracting surfaces of a\nglass prism show exciting phenomenon.  Let us find it out through an\nactivity.\nPE – Incident ray ∠ i – Angle of incidence\nEF – Refracted ray ∠ r – Angle of refraction\nFS – Emergent ray ∠ e – Angle of emergence\n∠ A – Angle of the prism ∠ D – Angle of deviation\nFigure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4Figure 10.4  Refraction of light through a triangular glass prism\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World 167\nThe prism has probably split the incident\nwhite light into a band of colours.  Note the\ncolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The various\ncolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,\nYellow, Orange and Red, as shown in\nFig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.\nThe band of the coloured components of a\nlight beam is called its spectrum. You might\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\nYet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However, he could not get any mor e colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism. This observation\ngave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven\ncolours.\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of\nsunlight is often referred to as white light.\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky\nafter a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion\nof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the\natmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction\nopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like\nsmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incident\nsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it\nagain when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due\nto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different\ncolours reach the observer’s eye.\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when\nyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water\nfountain, with the Sun behind you.\nFigure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\nFigure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of\nwhite light\nFigure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky\nFigure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Rainbow formation\nSunlight\nRaindrop\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nScience168\nFigure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10Figure 10.10\nAtmospheric refraction\neffects at sunrise and\nsunset\n10.5   \n   ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION\nYou might have observed the apparent random wavering or\nflickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air\nrising above a fire or a radiator. The air just above the fire becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates.\nThis wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.\nTwinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers –  the\nstar sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which\nis the twinkling effect.\nWhy don’t the planets twinkle? The planets are much\ncloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.\nIf we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\nof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\npoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.\nAdvance sunrise and delayed sunset\nThe Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual\nsunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset\nbecause of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we\nmean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.\n10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the\nSun with respect to the horizon. The time difference\nbetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about\n2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.\nFigure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9\nApparent star position\ndue to atmospheric\nrefraction\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World 169\n10.6  SC ATTERING OF LIGHT\nThe interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several\nspectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.\nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.\nHowever, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the\nsize of the particles is relatively larger.\n10.6.1 Tyndall Effect\nThe earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.\nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air . When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.\nThus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest.  Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.  If the size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite.\n10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.  The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not\nprominent at such heights.\nYou might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour.\nDo you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke.  Therefore,\nit can be seen in the same colour at a distance.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nScience170\nWhat you have learnt\n/square6The ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its\nfocal length, is called the accommodation of the eye.\n/square6The smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is\ncalled the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision.  For a young\nadult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm.\n/square6The common refractive defects of vision include myopia, hypermetropia and\npresbyopia. Myopia (short-sightedness – the image of distant objects is focussed\nbefore the r etina) is corr ected by using a concave lens of suitable power .\nHypermetropia (far-sightedness – the image of nearby objects is focussed beyond\nthe retina) is corr\nected by using a convex lens of suitable power. The eye loses its\npower of accommodation at old age.\n/square6The splitting of white light into its component colours is called dispersion.\n/square6Scattering of light causes the blue colour of sky.\nEXERCISES"

For parallel refracting surfaces, as in a glass slab, the emergent ray\nis parallel to the incident ray.  However, it is slightly displaced laterally.\nHow would light get refracted through a transparent prism? Consider a\ntriangular glass prism. It has two triangular bases and three rectangular\nlateral surfaces. These surfaces are inclined to each other. The angle\nbetween its two lateral faces is called the angle of the prism. Let us now\ndo an activity to study the refraction of light through a triangular glass\nprism.\n/square6Eyes must be removed within 4-6 hours after death. Inform the nearest eye bank\nimmediately.\n/square6The eye bank team will remove the eyes at the home of the deceased or at a hospital.\n/square6Eye removal takes only 10-15 minutes. It is a simple process and does not lead to\nany disfigurement.\n/square6Persons who were infected with or died because of AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, rabies,\nacute leukaemia, tetanus, cholera, meningitis or encephalitis cannot donate eyes.\nAn eye bank collects, evaluates and distributes the donated eyes. All eyes donated are\nevaluated using strict medical standards. Those donated eyes found unsuitable for\ntransplantation are used for valuable research and medical education. The identities\nof both the donor and the recipient remain confidential.\nOne pair of eyes gives vision to up to FOUR CORNEAL BLIND PEOPLE.\nActivity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1Activity 10.1\n/square6Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\n/square6Place a glass prism on it in such a way that it rests on its triangular\nbase.

You may note that a ray of light is entering fr\nom air to\nglass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards\nthe normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from\nglass to air. Hence it has bent away from normal. Compare the angle of\nincidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the\nprism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?\nThe peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an\nangle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of\ndeviation. In this case ∠ D is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle of\ndeviation in the above activity and measure it.\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL ASS PRISM ASS PRISMASS PRISM ASS PRISMASS PRISM\nYou must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow.\nHow could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the\nrainbow?

        "content": "--- Page 7 ---\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World 167\nThe prism has probably split the incident\nwhite light into a band of colours.  Note the\ncolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The various\ncolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,\nYellow, Orange and Red, as shown in\nFig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.\nThe band of the coloured components of a\nlight beam is called its spectrum. You might\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\nYet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However, he could not get any mor e colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism. This observation\ngave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven\ncolours.\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of\nsunlight is often referred to as white light.\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky\nafter a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion\nof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the\natmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction\nopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like\nsmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incident\nsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it\nagain when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due\nto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different\ncolours reach the observer’s eye.\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when\nyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water\nfountain, with the Sun behind you.\nFigure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\nFigure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of\nwhite light\nFigure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky\nFigure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Rainbow formation\nSunlight\nRaindrop\n2024-25",

The air just above the fire becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates.\nThis wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.\nTwinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers –  the\nstar sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which\nis the twinkling effect.\nWhy don’t the planets twinkle? The planets are much\ncloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.\nIf we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\nof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\npoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.\nAdvance sunrise and delayed sunset\nThe Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual\nsunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset\nbecause of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we\nmean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.\n10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the\nSun with respect to the horizon. The time difference\nbetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about\n2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.\nFigure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9\nApparent star position\ndue to atmospheric\nrefraction\n2024-25",

The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.\nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.\nHowever, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the\nsize of the particles is relatively larger.\n10.6.1 Tyndall Effect\nThe earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.\nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air . When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.\nThus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest.  Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.  If the size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite.\n10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.  The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not\nprominent at such heights.\nYou might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour.\nDo you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke.  Therefore,\nit can be seen in the same colour at a distance.\n2024-25",

Based on\nthis evidence, suggest a possible rule for the inheritance of earlobe\ntypes.\n8.2.2 Rules for the Inheritance of T raits  – –– ––\nMendel’s Contributions\nThe rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to\nthe fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal\namounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can\nbe influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait\nthere will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in\nthe child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such\ninheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from\nmore than a century ago.\nFigure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2\n(a) Free and (b) attached\nearlobes. The lowest part\nof the ear , called the\nearlobe, is closely attached\nto the side of the head in\nsome of us, and not\nin others.

Bacteria that can withstand heat will survive\nbetter in a heat wave, as we have discussed earlier. Selection of variants\nby environmental factors forms the basis for evolutionary processes, as\nwe will discuss in later sections.\n(a)\n(b)\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nHeredity 131\nx\nRR yy\n(round, green)\nrr YY\n(wrinkled, yellow)\nRy\n rY\nRr Yy\n(round, yellow)\nF1\nx\nRr Yy\nF1\nRr Yy\nF1\n315 round, yellow\n108 round, green\n101 wrinkled, yellow\n32 wrinkled, green\n9\n3\n3\n1\n556 seeds 16\nFigure 9.5 Independent inheritance of two\nseparate traits, shape and colour of seeds\nRY Ry rY ry\nRY\nRy\nrY\nry\nRRYY RRYy RrYY RrYy\nRRYy RRyy RrYy Rryy\nRrYY RrYy rrYY rrYy\nRrYy Rryy rrYy rryy\nF2\nFigure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5\nIndependent inheritance\nof two separate traits,\nshape and colour of seeds\nWhat happens when pea plants showing two different\ncharacteristics, rather than just one, are bred with each other?\nWhat do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short\nplant with wrinkled-seeds look like? They are all tall and have\nround seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits.\nBut what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate\nF2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find\nthat some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some\nwere short plants with wrinkled seeds.  However, there would also\nbe some F2 progeny that showed new combinations. Some of them\nwould be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short,\nbut have round seeds. You can see as to how new combinations of\ntraits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed\nshape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form\nF2 offspring (Fig. 8.5). Thus, the tall/short trait and the round\nseed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited.\n8.2.3 How do these Traits get Expressed?\nHow does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is\nthe information source for making proteins in the cell. A section\nof DNA that provides information for one protein is called the\ngene for that protein. How do proteins control the\ncharacteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the\nexample of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants\nhave hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus\ndepend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The\namount of the plant hormone made will depend on the\nefficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme\nthat is important for this process. If this enzyme works\nefficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be\ntall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes\nthe enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,\nand the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,\nor traits.\nIf the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been\ndiscussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing\nequally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction.\nWe have disscussed this issue in the previous Chapter. If both\nparents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents\nmust be contributing a copy of the same gene. This means that\neach pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from\neach parent. For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must\nhave only one gene set.\nHow do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two\ncopies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a\nsingle whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained\nin Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and\n‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently\nFigure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nScience132\ninherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not\nas a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,\neach called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance\nexplains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all\nsexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms\nalso follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their\ninheritance might work?\n8.2.4 Sex Determination\nWe have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual\nreproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number\nof reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual\ndetermined? Different species use very different strategies\nfor this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,\nin some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at\nwhich fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the\nanimals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In\nother animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,\nindicating that sex is not genetically determined. However,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls.\nBut so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets ar\ne\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex?\nThe explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is\nodd in not always being a per fect pair. Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,\nwhile men ar e XY . Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be?\nAs Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome\nfrom their mother regardless of whether they are boys or\ngirls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by\nwhat they inherit from their father. A child who inherits\nan X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one\nwho inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.\nFigure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6\nSex determination in\nhuman beings\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nHeredity 133\nQUESTIONS\n?"

Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance\nexplains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all\nsexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms\nalso follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their\ninheritance might work?\n8.2.4 Sex Determination\nWe have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual\nreproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number\nof reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual\ndetermined? Different species use very different strategies\nfor this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,\nin some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at\nwhich fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the\nanimals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In\nother animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,\nindicating that sex is not genetically determined. However,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls.\nBut so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets ar\ne\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex?\nThe explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is\nodd in not always being a per fect pair. Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,\nwhile men ar e XY . Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be?\nAs Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome\nfrom their mother regardless of whether they are boys or\ngirls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by\nwhat they inherit from their father. A child who inherits\nan X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one\nwho inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.\nFigure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6\nSex determination in\nhuman beings\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nHeredity 133\nQUESTIONS\n?",

Since the electrons are shared between\natoms and no charged particles are formed, such covalent compounds\nare generally poor conductors of electricity.\nAllotropes of carbon\nThe element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with\nwidely varying physical properties. Both diamond and\ngraphite are formed by carbon atoms, the difference lies in\nthe manner in which the carbon atoms are bonded to one\nanother. In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four\nother carbon atoms forming a rigid three-dimensional\nstructure. In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three\nother carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array.\nOne of these bonds is a double-bond, and thus the valency of\ncarbon is satisfied. Graphite structure is formed by the\nhexagonal arrays being placed in layers one above the other.\nMore to Know!\nThe structure of graphite\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nScience62\n4.2 VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON\nWe have seen the for mation of covalent bonds by the sharing of\nelectrons in various elements and compounds. We have also seen the\nstructure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning\nof the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In\nfact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers\nof carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was\nrecently estimated to be in million s! This outnumbers by a large\nmargin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together.\nWhy is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element?\nThe nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a large number\nof compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon ar e –\n(i) Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of\ncarbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called\ncatenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon,\nbranched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings.\nIn addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple\nbonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single\nbonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds.\nCompounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their\ncarbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.\nNo other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent\nseen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with\nhydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these\ncompounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong\nand hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds\nwith many carbon atoms linked to each other.\n(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with\nfour other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent\nelement. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen,\nnitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to\ncompounds with specific properties which depend on the elements\nother than carbon present in the molecule.\nAgain the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are\nvery strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One\nreason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size.\nThis enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons\nstrongly. The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are\nmuch weaker.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nCarbon and its Compounds 63\nOrganic compounds\nThe two characteristic features seen in carbon, that is, tetravalency and catenation, put\ntogether give rise to a large number of compounds. Many have the same non-carbon\natom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains. These compounds were\ninitially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon\ncompounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system. That is,\nit was postulated that a ‘vital force’ was necessary for their synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler\ndisproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate. But carbon\ncompounds, except for carbides, oxides of carbon, carbonate and hydrogencarbonate\nsalts continue to be studied under organic chemistry.\n4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds\nWe have already seen the structur e of methane. Another compound\nformed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of C2H6.\nIn order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon\ncompounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms\ntogether with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the\nhydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon\n(Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure of ethane is arrived\nin the following steps –\nC—C Step 1\nFigure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 (a) Carbon atoms linked together with a single bond\nThree valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied,\nso each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving:\nStep 2\nFigure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 (b)     Each carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms\nThe electron dot structure of ethane is shown in Fig. 4.6(c).\nCan you draw the structure of propane, which has the molecular\nformula C3H8 in a similar manner? You will see that the valencies of all\nthe atoms are satisfied by single bonds between them. Such carbon\ncompounds are called saturated compounds. These compounds are\nnormally not very reactive.\nHowever, another compound of carbon and hydrogen has the formula\nC2H4 and is called ethene. How can this molecule be depicted? We follow\nthe same step-wise approach as above.\nCarbon-carbon atoms linked together with a single bond (Step 1).\nWe see that one valency per carbon atom r emains unsatisfied\n(Step 2). This can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the\ntwo carbons (Step 3).\nFigure 4.6Figure 4.6Figure 4.6Figure 4.6Figure 4.6\n(c)     Electron dot structure of\nethane\nMore to Know!\nStep 2\nStep 3\nC—C        Step 1\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nScience64\nThe electron dot structure for ethene is given in Fig. 4.7.\nYet another compound of hydrogen and carbon has the formula\nC2H2 and is called ethyne. Can you draw the electron dot\nstructure for ethyne? How many bonds are necessary between\nthe two carbon atoms in order to satisfy their valencies? Such\ncompounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between\nthe carbon atoms are known as unsaturated carbon compounds\nand they are more reactive than the saturated carbon\ncompounds.\n4.2.2 Chains, Branches and Rings\nIn the earlier section, we mentioned the carbon compounds methane,\nethane and propane, containing respectively 1, 2 and 3 carbon atoms.\nSuch ‘chains’ of carbon atoms can contain many more carbon atoms.\nThe names and structures of six of these are given in Table 4.2.\nFigure 4.7Figure 4.7Figure 4.7Figure 4.7Figure 4.7\nStructure of ethene\nTable 4.2 Formulae and structures of saturated compounds of carbon and hydrogen\nNo. of C Name Formula Structure\natoms\n1 Methane CH4\n2 Ethane C2H6\n3 Propane C3H8\n4 Butane C4H10\n5 Pentane C5H12\n6 Hexane C6H14\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nCarbon and its Compounds 65\nBut, let us take another look at butane. If we make the carbon\n‘skeleton’ with four carbon atoms, we see that two different possible\n‘skeletons’ are –\nC—C—C—C\nFigure 4.8 Figure 4.8 Figure 4.8 Figure 4.8 Figure 4.8 (a) Two possible carbon-skeletons\nFilling the remaining valencies with hydrogen gives us –\nFigure 4.8 Figure 4.8 Figure 4.8 Figure 4.8 Figure 4.8 (b) Complete molecules for two structures with formula C4H10\nWe see that both these structures have the same formula C4H10. Such\ncompounds with identical molecular formula but different structures\nare called structural isomers.\nIn addition to straight and branched carbon chains, some compounds\nhave carbon atoms arranged in the form of a ring. For example, cyclohexane\nhas the formula C6H12 and the following structure –\n(a) (b)\nFigure 4.9 Figure 4.9 Figure 4.9 Figure 4.9 Figure 4.9 Structure of cyclohexane (a) carbon skeleton (b) complete molecule\nCan you draw the electron dot structure for cyclohexane? Straight\nchain, branched chain and cyclic carbon compounds, all may be saturated\nor unsaturated. For example, benzene, C6H6, has the following structure –\nBenzene — C 6H6\nFigure 4.10 Figure 4.10 Figure 4.10 Figure 4.10 Figure 4.10 Structure of benzene\nAll these carbon compounds which contain only carbon and\nhydrogen are called hydrocarbons. Among these, the saturated\nhydrocarbons are called alkanes. The unsaturated hydrocarbons which\ncontain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Those containing\none or more triple bonds are called alkynes.\n4.2.3 Will you be my Friend?\nCarbon seems to be a very friendly element. So far we have been looking at\ncompounds containing carbon and hydrogen only. But carbon also forms\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nScience66\nbonds with other elements such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur.\nIn a hydrocarbon chain, one or more hydrogens can be replaced by these\nelements, such that the valency of carbon remains satisfied. In such\ncompounds, the element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a heteroatom.\nThese heteroatoms are also present in some groups as given in Table 4.3.\nThese heteroatoms and\nthe group containing\nthese confer specific\nproperties to the\ncompound, regardless\nof the length and nature\nof the carbon chain and\nhence are called\nfunctional groups. Some\nimportant functional\ngroups are given in the\nTable 4.3. Free valency or\nvalencies of the group\nare shown by the single\nline. The functional group\nis attached to the carbon\nchain through this\nvalency by replacing one\nhydrogen   atom or\natoms.\n4.2.4 Homologous Series\nYou have seen that carbon atoms can be linked together to form chains\nof varying lengths. These chains can be branched also. In addition,\nhydrogen atom or other atoms on these carbon chains can be replaced\nby any of the functional groups that we saw above. The presence of a\nfunctional group such as alcohol decides the properties of the carbon\ncompound, regardless of the length of the carbon chain. For example,\nthe chemical properties of CH3OH, C2H5OH, C3H7OH and C4H9OH are all\nvery similar. Hence, such a series of compounds in which the same\nfunctional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain is called a\nhomologous series.\nLet us look at the homologous series that we saw earlier in Table\n4.2. If we look at the formulae of successive compounds, say –\nCH4 and C2H6 — these differ by a –CH2- unit\nC2H6 and C3H8 — these differ by a –CH2- unit\nWhat is the difference between the next pair – propane and butane (C4H10)?\nCan you find out the difference in molecular masses between these\npairs (the atomic mass of carbon is 12 u and the atomic mass of hydrogen\nis 1 u)?\nSimilarly, take the homologous series for alkenes. The first member\nof the series is ethene which we have already come across in\nSection 4.2.1. What is the formula for ethene? The succeeding members\nhave the formula C3H6, C4H8 and C5H10. Do these also differ by a –CH2–\nTable 4.3 Some functional groups in carbon compounds\nHetero HeteroHetero HeteroHetero Class of Class ofClass of Class ofClass of Formula ofFormula ofFormula ofFormula ofFormula of\natom atomatom atomatom compoundscompoundscompoundscompoundscompounds functional groupfunctional groupfunctional groupfunctional groupfunctional group\nCl/Br Halo- (Chloro/bromo) —Cl, —Br\nalkane (substitutes for\nhydrogen atom)\nOxygen 1.

For example,\nthe names of the alcohols taken in Activity 4.2 are methanol, ethanol,\npropanol and butanol.\nNaming a carbon compound can be done by the following method –\n(i) Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound.

For example, a three-carbon chain\nwith a ketone group would be named in the following manner –\nPropane – ‘e’ = propan + ‘one’ = propanone.\n(iv) If the carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’ in the name\nof the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given in\nTable 4.4.

Since most of the fuels we use are either carbon\nor its compounds, we shall first study combustion.\n4.3.1 Combustion4.3.1 Combustion4.3.1 Combustion4.3.1 Combustion4.3.1 Combustion\nCarbon, in all its allotropic forms, burns in oxygen to give carbon dioxide\nalong with the release of heat and light. Most carbon compounds also\nrelease a large amount of heat and light on burning. These are the\noxidation reactions that you learnt about in the first Chapter –\n(i) C + O2 →  CO2 + heat and light\n(ii) CH4 + O2 →  CO2 + H2O + heat and light\n(iii) CH3CH2OH + O2 →  CO2 + H2O + heat and light\nBalance the latter two reactions like you learnt in the first Chapter.\nActivity 4.3Activity 4.3Activity 4.3Activity 4.3Activity 4.3\nCAUTION: This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\n/square6Take some carbon compounds (naphthalene,\ncamphor, alcohol) one by one on a spatula and bur n\nthem.\n/square6Observe the nature of the flame and note whether\nsmoke is produced.\n/square6Place a metal plate above the flame. Is there a deposition\non the plate in case of any of the compounds?\nActivity 4.4Activity 4.4Activity 4.4Activity 4.4Activity 4.4\n/square6Light a bunsen burner and\nadjust the air hole at the\nbase to get different types of\nflames/presence of smoke.\n/square6When do you get a yellow,\nsooty flame?\n/square6When do you get a blue\nflame?\nSaturated hydrocarbons will generally give a clean flame while\nunsaturated carbon compounds will give a yellow flame with lots of\nblack smoke. This results in a sooty deposit on the metal plate in Activity\n4.3. However, limiting the supply of air results in incomplete combustion\nof even saturated hydrocarbons giving a sooty flame. The gas/kerosene\nstove used at home has inlets for air so that a sufficiently oxygen-rich\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nScience70\nmixture is burnt to give a clean blue flame. If you observe the bottoms of\ncooking vessels getting blackened, it means that the air holes are blocked\nand fuel is getting wasted. Fuels such as coal and petroleum have some\namount of nitrogen and sulphur in them. Their combustion results in\nthe formation of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen which are major\npollutants in the environment.\nDo You Know?\nWhy do substances burn with or without a flame?\nHave you ever observed either a coal or a wood fire? If not, the next time you get a\nchance, take close note of what happens when the wood or coal starts to burn. You\nhave seen above that a candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However,\nyou will observe the coal or charcoal in an ‘angithi’ sometimes just glows red and\ngives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous\nsubstances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present\nvapourise and burn with a flame in the beginning.\nA luminous flame is seen when the atoms of the gaseous substance are heated and\nstart to glow. The colour produced by each element is a characteristic property of\nthat element. Try and heat a copper wire in the flame of a gas stove and observe its\ncolour. You have seen that incomplete combustion gives soot which is carbon. On\nthis basis, what will you attribute the yellow colour of a candle flame to?\nFormation of coal and petroleum\nCoal and petroleum have been formed from biomass which has been subjected to\nvarious biological and geological processes. Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and\nother plants that lived millions of years ago. These were crushed into the earth,\nperhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They were pressed down by layers of\nearth and rock. They slowly decayed into coal. Oil and gas are the remains of millions\nof tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. When they died, their bodies sank to\nthe sea bed and were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning\nthem into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to.\nMeanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. The oil and gas seeped into the\nporous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. Can you guess why\ncoal and petroleum are called fossil fuels?\n4.3.2 Oxidation\nActivity 4.5Activity 4.5Activity 4.5Activity 4.5Activity 4.5\n/square6Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube and warm it\ngently in a water bath.\n/square6Add a 5% solution of alkaline potassium permanganate\ndrop by drop to this solution.\n/square6Does the colour of potassium permanganate persist when\nit is added initially?\n/square6Why does the colour of potassium permanganate not\ndisappear when excess is added?\nYou have lear nt\nabout oxidation reactions in\nthe first Chapter . Carbon\ncompounds can be easily\noxidised on combustion. In\naddition to this complete\noxidation, we have reactions\nin which alcohols are\nconverted to carboxylic\nacids –\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nCarbon and its Compounds 71\nWe see that some substances are capable of adding oxygen to others.\nThese substances are known as oxidising agents.\nAlkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate\nare oxidising alcohols to acids, that is, adding oxygen to the starting\nmaterial. Hence they are known as oxidising agents.\n4.3.3 Addition Reaction\nUnsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts\nsuch as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons. Catalysts\nare substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different\nrate without the reaction itself being affected. This reaction is commonly\nused in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst.\nVegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains while\nanimal fats have saturated carbon chains.\nYou must have seen advertisements stating that some vegetable oils\nare ‘healthy’. Animal fats generally contain saturated fatty acids which\nare said to be harmful for health. Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids\nshould be chosen for cooking.\n4.3.4 Substitution Reaction\nSaturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence\nof most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added\nto hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen\natoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type\nof atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another . A number of\nproducts are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes.\nCH4 + Cl2 →  CH3Cl + HCl (in the presence of sunlight)\n?\nQUESTIONS"

But here we shall study\nthe properties of two commercially important compounds – ethanol and\nethanoic acid.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nScience72\n4.4.1 Properties of Ethanol\nEthanol is a liquid at room temperature (refer to Table 4.1 for the melting\nand boiling points of ethanol). Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and\nis the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. In addition, because it is a\ngood solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough\nsyrups, and many tonics. Ethanol is also soluble in water in all\nproportions. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes\ndrunkenness. Even though this practice is condemned, it is a socially\nwidespread practice. However, intake of even a small quantity of pure\nethanol (called absolute alcohol) can be lethal. Also, long-term\nconsumption of alcohol leads to many health problems.\nReactions of EthanolReactions of EthanolReactions of EthanolReactions of EthanolReactions of Ethanol\n(i) Reaction with sodium –\nActivity 4.6Activity 4.6Activity 4.6Activity 4.6Activity 4.6\nTeacher’s demonstration  –\n/square6Drop a small piece of sodium,\nabout the size of a couple of\ngrains of rice, into ethanol\n(absolute alcohol).\n/square6What do you observe?\n/square6How will you test the gas evolved?\n2Na + 2CH3CH2OH →  2CH3CH2O– Na+ + H2\n (Sodium ethoxide)\nAlcohols react with sodium leading to the\nevolution of hydrogen. With ethanol, the other\nproduct is sodium ethoxide. Can you recall which\nother substances produce hydrogen on reacting with\nmetals?\n(ii) Reaction to give unsaturated hydrocarbon: Heating ethanol at\n443 K with excess concentrated sulphuric acid results in the\ndehydration of ethanol to give ethene –\nCH CH OH CH  = CH  + H O3 2 2 2 2\nHo\nt Conc.\nH SO2 4\n−  →   \nThe concentrated sulphuric acid can be regarded as a dehydrating\nagent which removes water from ethanol.\nHow do alcohols affect living beings?\nWhen large quantities of ethanol are consumed, it tends to slow metabolic processes\nand to depress the central nervous system. This results in lack of coordination,\nmental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and finally stupor.\nThe individual may feel relaxed without realising that his sense of judgement, sense\nof timing, and muscular coordination have been seriously impaired.\nUnlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol\nis oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of\ncells. It coagulates the protoplasm, in much the same way an egg is coagulated by\ncooking. Methanol also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness.\nEthanol is an important industrial solvent. To prevent the misuse of ethanol produced\nfor industrial use, it is made unfit for drinking by adding poisonous substances\nlike methanol to it. Dyes are also added to colour the alcohol blue so that it can be\nidentified easily. This is called denatured alcohol.\nDo You Know?\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nCarbon and its Compounds 73\n4.4.2 Properties of Ethanoic Acid\nEthanoic acid is commonly called acetic acid and\nbelongs to a group of acids called carboxylic\nacids. 5-8% solution of acetic acid in water is\ncalled vinegar and is used widely as a preservative\nin pickles. The melting point of pure ethanoic acid\nis 290 K and hence it often freezes during winter\nin cold climates. This gave rise to its name glacial\nacetic acid.\nThe group of organic compounds called\ncarboxylic acids are obviously characterised by\ntheir acidic nature. However, unlike mineral acids\nlike HCl, which are completely ionised, carboxylic\nacids are weak acids.\nActivity 4.7Activity 4.7Activity 4.7Activity 4.7Activity 4.7\nn Compare the pH of dilute acetic acid\nand dilute hydrochloric acid using\nboth litmus paper and universal\nindicator.\nn Are both acids indicated by the\nlitmus test?\nn Does the universal indicator show\nthem as equally strong acids?\nActivity 4.8Activity 4.8Activity 4.8Activity 4.8Activity 4.8\nn Take 1 mL ethanol (absolute alcohol)\nand 1 mL glacial acetic acid along\nwith a few drops of concentrated\nsulphuric acid in a test tube.\nn Warm in a water-bath for at least five\nminutes as shown in Fig. 4.11.\nn Pour into a beaker containing\n20-50 mL of water and smell the\nresulting mixture.\nReactions of ethanoic acid:Reactions of ethanoic acid:Reactions of ethanoic acid:Reactions of ethanoic acid:Reactions of ethanoic acid:\n(i) Esterification reaction: Esters are most commonly\nformed by reaction of an acid and an alcohol.\nEthanoic acid reacts with absolute ethanol in the\npresence of an acid catalyst to give an ester –\nCH COOH CH CH OH CH C C CH CH H O3 3 2 3 2 3 2\nAcid\nO\n(E\n− + − − − − − +\n11\nt thanoic acid)            (Ethanol)                               (Ester)\nO\nGenerally, esters are sweet-smelling substances. These are used in\nmaking perfumes and as flavouring agents. On treating with sodium\nhydroxide, which is an alkali, the ester is converted back to  alcohol\nand sodium salt of carboxylic acid. This reaction is known as\nsaponification because it is used in the preparation of soap. Soaps\nare sodium or potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acid.\nFigure 4.11Figure 4.11Figure 4.11Figure 4.11Figure 4.11\nFormation of ester\nAlcohol as a fuelAlcohol as a fuelAlcohol as a fuelAlcohol as a fuelAlcohol as a fuel\nSugarcane plants are one of the most efficient convertors of sunlight into chemical\nenergy.

Most dirt is\noily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water . The\nmolecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic\nacids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain\ninteracts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called\nmicelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil\ndroplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in\nwater. The soap micelle thus helps  in pulling out the dirt in water and\nwe can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13).\nCan you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if\nyou dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?\nMicelles\nSoaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic,\nthat is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts\nwith hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap\nwill not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the\nionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside water,\nthese molecules have a unique orientation that keeps\nthe hydr ocarbon portion out of the water . Thus,\nclusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails\nare in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends\nare on the surface of the cluster. This formation is\ncalled a micelle. Soap in the form of a micelle is able\nto clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the\ncentre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as\na colloid and will not come together to precipitate\nbecause of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt\nsuspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away.\nThe soap micelles are large enough to scatter light.\nHence a soap solution appears cloudy.\nFigure 4.13Figure 4.13Figure 4.13Figure 4.13Figure 4.13  Effect of soap in cleaning\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nScience76\nActivity 4.11Activity 4.11Activity 4.11Activity 4.11Activity 4.11\n/square6Take about 10 mL of distilled water (or rain water) and 10 mL of\nhard water (from a tubewell or hand-pump) in separate test tubes.\n/square6Add a couple of drops of soap solution to both.\n/square6Shake the test tubes vigorously for an equal period of time and\nobserve the amount of foam formed.\n/square6In which test tube do you get more foam?\n/square6In which test tube do you observe a white curdy precipitate?\nNote for the teache r : If hard water is not available in your locality,\nprepare some hard water by dissolving hydrogencarbonates/\nsulphates/chlorides of calcium or magnesium in water .\nActivity 4.12Activity 4.12Activity 4.12Activity 4.12Activity 4.12\n/square6Take two test tubes with about 10 mL of hard water in each.\n/square6Add five drops of soap solution to one and five drops of detergent\nsolution to the other .\n/square6Shake both test tubes for the same period.\n/square6Do both test tubes have the same amount of foam?\n/square6In which test tube is a curdy solid formed?\n?\nQUESTIONS"

        "content": "--- Page 5 ---\nScience62\n4.2 VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON\nWe have seen the for mation of covalent bonds by the sharing of\nelectrons in various elements and compounds. We have also seen the\nstructure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning\nof the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In\nfact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers\nof carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was\nrecently estimated to be in million s! This outnumbers by a large\nmargin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together.\nWhy is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element?\nThe nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a large number\nof compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon ar e –\n(i) Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of\ncarbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called\ncatenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon,\nbranched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings.\nIn addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple\nbonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single\nbonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds.\nCompounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their\ncarbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.\nNo other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent\nseen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with\nhydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these\ncompounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong\nand hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds\nwith many carbon atoms linked to each other.\n(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with\nfour other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent\nelement. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen,\nnitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to\ncompounds with specific properties which depend on the elements\nother than carbon present in the molecule.\nAgain the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are\nvery strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One\nreason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size.\nThis enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons\nstrongly. The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are\nmuch weaker.\n2024-25",

Many have the same non-carbon\natom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains. These compounds were\ninitially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon\ncompounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system. That is,\nit was postulated that a ‘vital force’ was necessary for their synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler\ndisproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate. But carbon\ncompounds, except for carbides, oxides of carbon, carbonate and hydrogencarbonate\nsalts continue to be studied under organic chemistry.\n4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds\nWe have already seen the structur e of methane. Another compound\nformed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of C2H6.\nIn order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon\ncompounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms\ntogether with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the\nhydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon\n(Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure of ethane is arrived\nin the following steps –\nC—C Step 1\nFigure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 (a) Carbon atoms linked together with a single bond\nThree valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied,\nso each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving:\nStep 2\nFigure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 Figure 4.6 (b)     Each carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms\nThe electron dot structure of ethane is shown in Fig. 4.6(c).\nCan you draw the structure of propane, which has the molecular\nformula C3H8 in a similar manner? You will see that the valencies of all\nthe atoms are satisfied by single bonds between them. Such carbon\ncompounds are called saturated compounds. These compounds are\nnormally not very reactive.\nHowever, another compound of carbon and hydrogen has the formula\nC2H4 and is called ethene. How can this molecule be depicted? We follow\nthe same step-wise approach as above.\nCarbon-carbon atoms linked together with a single bond (Step 1).\nWe see that one valency per carbon atom r emains unsatisfied\n(Step 2). This can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the\ntwo carbons (Step 3).\nFigure 4.6Figure 4.6Figure 4.6Figure 4.6Figure 4.6\n(c)     Electron dot structure of\nethane\nMore to Know!\nStep 2\nStep 3\nC—C        Step 1\n2024-25",

In such\ncompounds, the element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a heteroatom.\nThese heteroatoms are also present in some groups as given in Table 4.3.\nThese heteroatoms and\nthe group containing\nthese confer specific\nproperties to the\ncompound, regardless\nof the length and nature\nof the carbon chain and\nhence are called\nfunctional groups. Some\nimportant functional\ngroups are given in the\nTable 4.3. Free valency or\nvalencies of the group\nare shown by the single\nline. The functional group\nis attached to the carbon\nchain through this\nvalency by replacing one\nhydrogen   atom or\natoms.\n4.2.4 Homologous Series\nYou have seen that carbon atoms can be linked together to form chains\nof varying lengths. These chains can be branched also. In addition,\nhydrogen atom or other atoms on these carbon chains can be replaced\nby any of the functional groups that we saw above. The presence of a\nfunctional group such as alcohol decides the properties of the carbon\ncompound, regardless of the length of the carbon chain. For example,\nthe chemical properties of CH3OH, C2H5OH, C3H7OH and C4H9OH are all\nvery similar. Hence, such a series of compounds in which the same\nfunctional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain is called a\nhomologous series.\nLet us look at the homologous series that we saw earlier in Table\n4.2. If we look at the formulae of successive compounds, say –\nCH4 and C2H6 — these differ by a –CH2- unit\nC2H6 and C3H8 — these differ by a –CH2- unit\nWhat is the difference between the next pair – propane and butane (C4H10)?\nCan you find out the difference in molecular masses between these\npairs (the atomic mass of carbon is 12 u and the atomic mass of hydrogen\nis 1 u)?\nSimilarly, take the homologous series for alkenes. The first member\nof the series is ethene which we have already come across in\nSection 4.2.1. What is the formula for ethene? The succeeding members\nhave the formula C3H6, C4H8 and C5H10.

This is because the melting and\nboiling points increase with increasing molecular mass. Other physical\nproperties such as solubility in a particular solvent also show a similar\ngradation. But the chemical properties, which are determined solely by\nthe functional group, remain similar in a homologous series.\nActivity 4.2Activity 4.2Activity 4.2Activity 4.2Activity 4.2\n4.2.5 Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds\nThe names of compounds in a homologous series are based on the name\nof the basic carbon chain modified by a “prefix” “phrase before” or “suffix”\n“phrase after” indicating the nature of the functional group. For example,\nthe names of the alcohols taken in Activity 4.2 are methanol, ethanol,\npropanol and butanol.\nNaming a carbon compound can be done by the following method –\n(i) Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound. A compound\nhaving three carbon atoms would have the name propane.\n(ii) In case a functional group is present, it is indicated in the\nname of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix (as given\nin Table 4.4).\n(iii) If the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, and the\nsuffix of the functional group begins with a vowel a, e, i, o, u, then\nthe name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final ‘e’ and\nadding the appropriate suffix. For example, a three-carbon chain\nwith a ketone group would be named in the following manner –\nPropane – ‘e’ = propan + ‘one’ = propanone.\n(iv) If the carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’ in the name\nof the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given in\nTable 4.4.

If you observe the bottoms of\ncooking vessels getting blackened, it means that the air holes are blocked\nand fuel is getting wasted. Fuels such as coal and petroleum have some\namount of nitrogen and sulphur in them. Their combustion results in\nthe formation of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen which are major\npollutants in the environment.\nDo You Know?\nWhy do substances burn with or without a flame?\nHave you ever observed either a coal or a wood fire? If not, the next time you get a\nchance, take close note of what happens when the wood or coal starts to burn. You\nhave seen above that a candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However,\nyou will observe the coal or charcoal in an ‘angithi’ sometimes just glows red and\ngives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous\nsubstances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present\nvapourise and burn with a flame in the beginning.\nA luminous flame is seen when the atoms of the gaseous substance are heated and\nstart to glow. The colour produced by each element is a characteristic property of\nthat element. Try and heat a copper wire in the flame of a gas stove and observe its\ncolour. You have seen that incomplete combustion gives soot which is carbon. On\nthis basis, what will you attribute the yellow colour of a candle flame to?\nFormation of coal and petroleum\nCoal and petroleum have been formed from biomass which has been subjected to\nvarious biological and geological processes. Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and\nother plants that lived millions of years ago. These were crushed into the earth,\nperhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They were pressed down by layers of\nearth and rock. They slowly decayed into coal. Oil and gas are the remains of millions\nof tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. When they died, their bodies sank to\nthe sea bed and were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning\nthem into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to.\nMeanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. The oil and gas seeped into the\nporous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. Can you guess why\ncoal and petroleum are called fossil fuels?\n4.3.2 Oxidation\nActivity 4.5Activity 4.5Activity 4.5Activity 4.5Activity 4.5\n/square6Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube and warm it\ngently in a water bath.\n/square6Add a 5% solution of alkaline potassium permanganate\ndrop by drop to this solution.\n/square6Does the colour of potassium permanganate persist when\nit is added initially?\n/square6Why does the colour of potassium permanganate not\ndisappear when excess is added?\nYou have lear nt\nabout oxidation reactions in\nthe first Chapter .

Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and\nis the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. In addition, because it is a\ngood solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough\nsyrups, and many tonics. Ethanol is also soluble in water in all\nproportions. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes\ndrunkenness. Even though this practice is condemned, it is a socially\nwidespread practice. However, intake of even a small quantity of pure\nethanol (called absolute alcohol) can be lethal. Also, long-term\nconsumption of alcohol leads to many health problems.\nReactions of EthanolReactions of EthanolReactions of EthanolReactions of EthanolReactions of Ethanol\n(i) Reaction with sodium –\nActivity 4.6Activity 4.6Activity 4.6Activity 4.6Activity 4.6\nTeacher’s demonstration  –\n/square6Drop a small piece of sodium,\nabout the size of a couple of\ngrains of rice, into ethanol\n(absolute alcohol).\n/square6What do you observe?\n/square6How will you test the gas evolved?\n2Na + 2CH3CH2OH →  2CH3CH2O– Na+ + H2\n (Sodium ethoxide)\nAlcohols react with sodium leading to the\nevolution of hydrogen.

This results in lack of coordination,\nmental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and finally stupor.\nThe individual may feel relaxed without realising that his sense of judgement, sense\nof timing, and muscular coordination have been seriously impaired.\nUnlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol\nis oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of\ncells. It coagulates the protoplasm, in much the same way an egg is coagulated by\ncooking. Methanol also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness.\nEthanol is an important industrial solvent. To prevent the misuse of ethanol produced\nfor industrial use, it is made unfit for drinking by adding poisonous substances\nlike methanol to it. Dyes are also added to colour the alcohol blue so that it can be\nidentified easily. This is called denatured alcohol.\nDo You Know?\n2024-25",

Most dirt is\noily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water . The\nmolecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic\nacids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain\ninteracts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called\nmicelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil\ndroplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in\nwater. The soap micelle thus helps  in pulling out the dirt in water and\nwe can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13).\nCan you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if\nyou dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?\nMicelles\nSoaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic,\nthat is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts\nwith hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap\nwill not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the\nionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside water,\nthese molecules have a unique orientation that keeps\nthe hydr ocarbon portion out of the water . Thus,\nclusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails\nare in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends\nare on the surface of the cluster. This formation is\ncalled a micelle. Soap in the form of a micelle is able\nto clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the\ncentre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as\na colloid and will not come together to precipitate\nbecause of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt\nsuspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away.\nThe soap micelles are large enough to scatter light.\nHence a soap solution appears cloudy.\nFigure 4.13Figure 4.13Figure 4.13Figure 4.13Figure 4.13  Effect of soap in cleaning\nMore to Know!\n2024-25",

Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.\nThe glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH– ) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nAcids, Bases and Salts 25\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\nWe know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH–  ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measur e pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH–  ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.\nQUESTIONS\n?"

Do you think life can exist on this planet?\nActivity 2.12Activity 2.12Activity 2.12Activity 2.12Activity 2.12\n/square6Put about 2 g soil in a test tube and add 5 mL water to it.\n/square6Shake the contents of the test tube.\n/square6Filter the contents and collect the filtrate in a test tube.\n/square6Check the pH of this filtrate with the help of universal\nindicator paper .\n/square6What can you conclude about the ideal soil pH for the growth of\nplants in your region?\npH in our digestive system\nIt is very interesting to note that our stomach produces hydrochloric\nacid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.\nDuring indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes\npain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid.\nMagnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for\nthis purpose.\npH change as the cause of tooth decay\nTooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth\nenamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium\nphosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in\nwater, but is corroded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria\npresent in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food\nparticles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent\nthis is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are\ngenerally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and\nprevent tooth decay.\nSelf defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare\nHave you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid\nwhich  causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda\non the stung area gives relief. Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject\nmethanoic acid causing burning pain.\nDo You\nKnow?\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nScience28\n2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL2.4 MORE ABOUT SAL TS TSTSTSTS\nIn the previous sections we have seen the formation of salts during\nvarious reactions.

This is the salt that you use in food.\nYou must have observed in the above Activity\nthat it is a neutral salt.\nSeawater contains many salts dissolved\nin it. Sodium chloride is separated from these\nsalts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in\nseveral parts of the world. These large crystals\nare often brown due to impurities. This is\ncalled rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed\nwhen seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt\nis mined like coal.\nYou must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March. Did\nyou know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our\nstruggle for freedom?\nTable 2.4\nSalt pH Acid used Base used\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nScience30\nCommon salt — A raw material for chemicals\nThe common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various\nmaterials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing\nsoda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\nSodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) →  2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products.\nBleaching powder\nYou have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder\nis represented as CaOCl 2, though the actual composition is quite\ncomplex.\nCa(OH)2 + Cl2 →  CaOCl2 + H2O\nFigure 2.8Figure 2.8Figure 2.8Figure 2.8Figure 2.8  Important products from the chlor-alkali process\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nAcids, Bases and Salts 31\nBleaching powder is used –\n(i) for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching\nwood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes\nin laundry;\n(ii) as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and\n(iii) to make drinking water free from germs.\nBaking soda\nThe baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy\npakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical\nname of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO 3). It is\nproduced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.\nNaCl + H O + CO + NH NH Cl + NaHCO2 2 3 4 3→\n(Ammonium (Sodium\nchloride) hydrogencarbonate)\nDid you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in Activity 2.14?\nCan you correlate why it can be used to neutralise an acid? It is a mild\nnon-corrosive basic salt. The following reaction takes place when it is\nheated during cooking –\n2NaHCO Na CO + H O+CO3 2 3 2 2\nHeat → \n(Sodium (Sodium\nhydrogencarbonate) carbonate)\nSodium hydrogencarbonate has got various uses in the household.\nUses of Baking soda\n(i) For making baking powder, which is a mixture of baking soda\n(sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as\ntartaric acid. When baking powder is heated or mixed in water,\nthe following reaction takes place –\nNaHCO3 + H+      →     CO2 + H2O + Sodium salt of acid\n         (From any acid)\nCarbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or\ncake to rise making them soft and spongy.\n(ii) Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.\nBeing alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and\nprovides relief.\n(iii) It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.\nWashing soda\nAnother chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is\nNa2CO3.10H2O (washing soda). Y ou have seen above that sodium\ncarbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda; recrystallisation of\nsodium carbonate gives washing soda. It is also a basic salt.\nNa CO H O Na CO H O\nSodium\ncar\nbonate\n2 3 2 2 3 210 10+ → .\n(\n)\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nScience32\nWhat does 10H2O signify? Does it make Na2CO3 wet? We will address\nthis question in the next section.\nSodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate are useful\nchemicals for many industrial processes as well.\nUses of washing soda\n(i) Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is used in glass, soap and\npaper industries.\n(ii) It is used in the manufacture of sodium compounds such as borax.\n(iii) Sodium carbonate can be used as a cleaning agent for domestic\npurposes.\n(iv) It is used for removing permanent hardness of water.\n2.4.4 Are the Crystals of Salts really Dry?\nActivity 2.15Activity 2.15Activity 2.15Activity 2.15Activity 2.15\n/square6Heat a few crystals of copper sulphate\nin a dry boiling tube.\n/square6What is the colour of the copper\nsulphate after heating?\n/square6Do you notice water droplets in the\nboiling tube? Where have these come\nfrom?\n/square6Add 2-3 drops of  water on the sample\nof copper sulphate obtained after\nheating.\n/square6What do you observe? Is the blue\ncolour of copper sulphate restored?\nFigure 2.9Figure 2.9Figure 2.9Figure 2.9Figure 2.9\nRemoving water\nof crystallisation\nCopper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of\ncrystallisation. When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the\nsalt turns white.\nIf you moisten the crystals again with water, you will find that blue\ncolour of the crystals reappears.\nWater of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present\nin one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one\nformula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper\nsulphate is Cu SO4. 5H2O. Now you would be able to answer the question\nwhether the molecule of Na2CO3.10H2O is wet.\nOne other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum.\nIt has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical\nformula CaSO4.2H2O. Let us look into the use of this salt.\nPlaster of Paris\nOn heating gypsum at 373 K, it loses water molecules and becomes\ncalcium sulphate hemihydrate (\n4 2\n1CaSO . H O2 ). This is called Plaster of\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nAcids, Bases and Salts 33\nParis, the substance which doctors use as plaster for supporting\nfractured bones in the right position.

We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH–  ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measur e pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH–  ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.\nQUESTIONS\n?",

To find out\nthe pH required for the healthy growth of a plant, you can collect the soil\nfrom various places and check the pH in the manner described below in\nActivity 2.12. Also, you can note down which plants are growing in the\nregion from which you have collected the soil.\nAcids in other planets\nThe atmosphere of venus is made up of thick white and yellowish clouds of\nsulphuric acid. Do you think life can exist on this planet?\nActivity 2.12Activity 2.12Activity 2.12Activity 2.12Activity 2.12\n/square6Put about 2 g soil in a test tube and add 5 mL water to it.\n/square6Shake the contents of the test tube.\n/square6Filter the contents and collect the filtrate in a test tube.\n/square6Check the pH of this filtrate with the help of universal\nindicator paper .\n/square6What can you conclude about the ideal soil pH for the growth of\nplants in your region?\npH in our digestive system\nIt is very interesting to note that our stomach produces hydrochloric\nacid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.\nDuring indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes\npain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid.\nMagnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for\nthis purpose.\npH change as the cause of tooth decay\nTooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth\nenamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium\nphosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in\nwater, but is corroded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria\npresent in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food\nparticles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent\nthis is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are\ngenerally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and\nprevent tooth decay.\nSelf defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare\nHave you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid\nwhich  causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda\non the stung area gives relief. Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject\nmethanoic acid causing burning pain.\nDo You\nKnow?\n2024-25",

Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\nSodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) →  2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products.\nBleaching powder\nYou have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder\nis represented as CaOCl 2, though the actual composition is quite\ncomplex.\nCa(OH)2 + Cl2 →  CaOCl2 + H2O\nFigure 2.8Figure 2.8Figure 2.8Figure 2.8Figure 2.8  Important products from the chlor-alkali process\n2024-25",

But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui  (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air. What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nScience106\nThere is no growth involved in this movement. On the other hand, the\ndirectional movement of a seedling is caused by growth. If it is prevented\nfrom growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different\ntypes of movement – one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth.\n6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response?\nFigure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4  The sensitive plant\nIf we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part\nof the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a\npoint different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.\nFinally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4).\n6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object.\nThis causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it.\nMore commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nControl and Coordination 107\nEnvironmental triggers such as light, or gravity\nwill change the directions that plant parts grow in.\nThese directional, or tropic, movements can be either\ntowards the stimulus, or away from it. So, in two\ndifferent kinds of phototropic movement, shoots\nrespond by bending towards light while roots\nrespond by bending away from it. How does this help\nthe plant?\nPlants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots\nof a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow\nupwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’\nrefers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’\nmean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms.\nLet us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow.\nGrowth-related movement of plants will be even slower.\nEven in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly.\nSo controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to\nstimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly.\nFor this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.\nActivity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2\n/square6Fill a conical flask with water .\n/square6Cover the neck of the flask with a wire mesh.\n/square6Keep two or three freshly germinated bean\nseeds on the wire mesh.\n/square6Take a cardboard box which is open from one\nside.\n/square6Keep the flask in the box in such a manner\nthat the open side of the box faces light coming\nfrom a window (Fig. 6.5).\n/square6After two or three days, you will notice that\nthe shoots bend towards light and roots away\nfrom light.\n/square6Now turn the flask so that the shoots are away\nfrom light and the roots towards light. Leave it\nundisturbed in this condition for a few days.\n/square6Have the old parts of the shoot and root\nchanged direction?\n/square6Are there differences in the direction of the new\ngrowth?\n/square6What can we conclude from this activity?\nFigure 6.5Figure 6.5Figure 6.5Figure 6.5Figure 6.5\nResponse of the plant to the direction of light\nFigure 6.6 Figure 6.6 Figure 6.6 Figure 6.6 Figure 6.6 Plant showing geotropism\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nScience108\nElectrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are\nlimitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication.\nIf, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound\nusing special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to\nrecognise information, and even transmit it. This will be slower, of course,\nbut it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous\nconnections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These\ncompounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control\nand coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect.\nDifferent plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action.\nLet us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2].\nWhen growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.\nThis concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light.\nAnother example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples\nof plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need\nsignals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which\ninhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.\nQUESTIONS\n?"

What do some animals, for instance squirrels,\nexperience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to\nprepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated\nactivities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many\ndifferent tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together\nin these actions. However, the two alternate activities, fighting or running,\nare also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common\npreparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved?\nIf the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.\nAdrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different\nparts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it\nacts include the heart. As a result, the heart beats faster, resulting in\nsupply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system\nand skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries\nin these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The\nbreathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the\ndiaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the\nanimal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones\nare part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control\nand coordination in our body.\nActivity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3\n/square6Look at Fig. 6.7.\n/square6Identify the endocrine glands mentioned in the figure.\n/square6Some of these glands have been listed in Table 6.1 and discussed\nin the text. Consult books in the library and discuss with your\nteachers to find out about other glands.\nRemember that plants have hormones that control their directional\ngrowth. What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it,\nwe cannot imagine their role in directional growth. We have never seen\nan animal growing more in one dir ection or the other, depending on\nlight or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident\nthat, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places.\nPlants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example.\nBut we do not grow fingers on our faces. The design of the body is carefully\nmaintained even during the growth of children.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nScience110\nLet us examine some examples to understand how hormones help\nin coordinated growth. We have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised\nsalt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised\nsalt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make\nthyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat\nmetabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth.\nIodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient\nin our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One\nof the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck. Can you correlate\nthis with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 6.7?\nSometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs)\nor extremely tall (giants). Have you ever wondered how this happens?\nGrowth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As\nits name indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development\nof the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it\nleads to dwarfism.\nYou must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance\nas well as that of your friends as you approached 10–12 years of age.\nThese changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of\ntestosterone in males and oestrogen in females.\nDo you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised\nby the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering\nfrom diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin.\nThis is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in\nregulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts,\nthe sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects.\nFigure 6.7 Endocrine glands in human beings (a) male, (b) female\n(a) (b)\nDo You Know?\nHypothalamus plays\nan important role in\nthe release of many\nhormones. For\nexample, when the\nlevel of growth\nhormone is low, the\nhypothalamus\nreleases growth\nhormone releasing\nfactor which\nstimulates the\npituitary gland to\nrelease growth\nhormone.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nControl and Coordination 111\nIf it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise\nquantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing\nand amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms.\nFor example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the\ncells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the\nblood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.\nTable 6.1 : Some important hormones and their functions\nActivity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4\n/square6  Hormones are secreted by endocrine glands and have specific functions.

But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui  (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air. What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nScience106\nThere is no growth involved in this movement. On the other hand, the\ndirectional movement of a seedling is caused by growth. If it is prevented\nfrom growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different\ntypes of movement – one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth.\n6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response?\nFigure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4  The sensitive plant\nIf we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part\nof the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a\npoint different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.\nFinally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4).\n6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object.\nThis causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it.\nMore commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example.\n2024-25",

So, in two\ndifferent kinds of phototropic movement, shoots\nrespond by bending towards light while roots\nrespond by bending away from it. How does this help\nthe plant?\nPlants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots\nof a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow\nupwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’\nrefers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’\nmean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms.\nLet us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow.\nGrowth-related movement of plants will be even slower.\nEven in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly.\nSo controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to\nstimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly.\nFor this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.\nActivity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2\n/square6Fill a conical flask with water .\n/square6Cover the neck of the flask with a wire mesh.\n/square6Keep two or three freshly germinated bean\nseeds on the wire mesh.\n/square6Take a cardboard box which is open from one\nside.\n/square6Keep the flask in the box in such a manner\nthat the open side of the box faces light coming\nfrom a window (Fig. 6.5).\n/square6After two or three days, you will notice that\nthe shoots bend towards light and roots away\nfrom light.\n/square6Now turn the flask so that the shoots are away\nfrom light and the roots towards light.

Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication.\nIf, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound\nusing special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to\nrecognise information, and even transmit it. This will be slower, of course,\nbut it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous\nconnections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These\ncompounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control\nand coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect.\nDifferent plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action.\nLet us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2].\nWhen growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.\nThis concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light.\nAnother example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples\nof plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need\nsignals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which\ninhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.\nQUESTIONS\n?",

What do some animals, for instance squirrels,\nexperience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to\nprepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated\nactivities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many\ndifferent tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together\nin these actions. However, the two alternate activities, fighting or running,\nare also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common\npreparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved?\nIf the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.\nAdrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different\nparts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it\nacts include the heart. As a result, the heart beats faster, resulting in\nsupply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system\nand skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries\nin these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The\nbreathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the\ndiaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the\nanimal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones\nare part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control\nand coordination in our body.\nActivity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3\n/square6Look at Fig. 6.7.\n/square6Identify the endocrine glands mentioned in the figure.\n/square6Some of these glands have been listed in Table 6.1 and discussed\nin the text. Consult books in the library and discuss with your\nteachers to find out about other glands.\nRemember that plants have hormones that control their directional\ngrowth. What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it,\nwe cannot imagine their role in directional growth. We have never seen\nan animal growing more in one dir ection or the other, depending on\nlight or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident\nthat, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places.\nPlants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example.\nBut we do not grow fingers on our faces. The design of the body is carefully\nmaintained even during the growth of children.\n2024-25",

We have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised\nsalt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised\nsalt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make\nthyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat\nmetabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth.\nIodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient\nin our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One\nof the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck. Can you correlate\nthis with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 6.7?\nSometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs)\nor extremely tall (giants). Have you ever wondered how this happens?\nGrowth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As\nits name indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development\nof the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it\nleads to dwarfism.\nYou must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance\nas well as that of your friends as you approached 10–12 years of age.\nThese changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of\ntestosterone in males and oestrogen in females.\nDo you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised\nby the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering\nfrom diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin.\nThis is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in\nregulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts,\nthe sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects.\nFigure 6.7 Endocrine glands in human beings (a) male, (b) female\n(a) (b)\nDo You Know?\nHypothalamus plays\nan important role in\nthe release of many\nhormones. For\nexample, when the\nlevel of growth\nhormone is low, the\nhypothalamus\nreleases growth\nhormone releasing\nfactor which\nstimulates the\npituitary gland to\nrelease growth\nhormone.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nControl and Coordination 111\nIf it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise\nquantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing\nand amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms.\nFor example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the\ncells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the\nblood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.\nTable 6.1 : Some important hormones and their functions\nActivity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4Activity 6.4\n/square6  Hormones are secreted by endocrine glands and have specific functions.

There is a\nrelationship between these three quantities\ngiven by the mirr or for mula which is\nexpressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f+ = (9.1)\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the\nobject. You must use the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention while substituting numerical\nvalues for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula\nfor solving problems.\nMagnification\nMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to\nwhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\nIt is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the\nobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.\nIf h is the height of the object and h′ is the height of the image, then\nthe magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by\nm = \nHeight of the image ( )\nHeight of the object ( )\n′h\nh\nm = ′h\nh (9.2)\nThe magnification m is also related to the object distance ( u) and\nimage distance (v).  It can be expressed as:\nMagnification (m)  = ′ = −h\nh\nv\nu (9.3)\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis.  The height of the\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images.  However, it is to be\ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the\nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value\nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.\nFigure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nScience144\nExample 9.1\nA convex mirror used for rear-view on an automobile has a radius of\ncurvature of 3.00 m.

Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its\ndirection? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond\ncontaining water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab\nis placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed\nthrough the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil\npartly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced\nat the interface of air and water. You might have observed that a lemon\nkept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual\nsize, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for such\nexperiences?\nLet us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil,\npartly immersed in water. The light reaching you from the portion of the\npencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared\nto the part above water. This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at\nthe interface. For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when\nseen through a glass slab placed over it.\nDoes a pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent, if instead of\nwater, we use liquids like kerosene or turpentine? Will the letters appear\nto rise to the same height if we replace a glass slab with a transparent\nplastic slab? You will find that the extent of the ef fect is different for\ndifferent pair of media. These observations indicate that light does not\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nScience146\ntravel in the same direction in all media. It appears that when travelling\nobliquely from one medium to another, the direction of propagation of\nlight in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as\nrefraction of light. Let us understand this phenomenon further by doing\na few activities.\nActivity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7Activity 9.7\n/square6Place a coin at the bottom of a bucket filled with water .\n/square6With your eye to a side above water , try to pick up the coin in one\ngo.

The\ncoin appears slightly raised above its actual position due to refraction of\nlight.\nActivity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9Activity 9.9\n/square6Draw a thick straight line in ink, over a sheet of white paper placed\non a Table.\n/square6Place a glass slab over the line in such a way that one of its edges\nmakes an angle with the line.\n/square6Look at the portion of the line under the slab from the sides.

Note that both the points O and O′ lie on surfaces\nseparating two transparent media. Draw a perpendicular NN’ to AB at O\nand another perpendicular MM′ to CD at O′. The light ray at point O has\nentered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to\nglass. Note that the light ray has bent towards\nthe normal. At O\n′, the light ray has entered\nfrom glass to air , that is, fr om a denser\nmedium to a rarer medium.  The light here\nhas bent away from the normal. Compare the\nangle of incidence with the angle of refraction\nat both refracting surfaces AB and CD.\nIn Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely\nincident on surface AB, called incident ray.\nOO\n′ is the refracted ray and O′ H is the\nemergent ray. Y ou may observe that the\nemergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nthe incident ray. Why does it happen so? The\nextent of bending of the ray of light at the\nopposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface)\nand CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular\nglass slab is equal and opposite. This is why\nthe ray emerges parallel to the incident ray.\nHowever, the light ray is shifted sidewar d\nslightly. What happens when a light ray is\nincident normally to the interface of two\nmedia? Try and find out.\nNow you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to\nchange in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to\nanother.  Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to\ncertain laws.\nActivity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10Activity 9.10\n/square6Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\n/square6Place a rectangular glass slab over the sheet in the middle.\n/square6Draw the outline of the slab with a pencil.

This law is also known as Snell’s law of\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90o)\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\nsin\nsin\ni\nr  = constant (9.4)\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\nwith respect to the first.  Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1 .  In air, the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the r efractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11.  Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2.  The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21. This can be expressed in an equation form as\nn21=\nSpeed of light in medium 1 \nSpeed of light in medium 2 = v\nv\n1\n2\n(9.5)\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12. It is given\nby\nn12= Speed of light in medium 2 \nSpeed of light in medium 1 = v\nv\n2\n1\n(9.6)\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2\nis considered with respect to vacuum.  This is called the absolute refractive\nindex of the medium.  It is simply represented as n2. If c is the speed of\nFigure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 149\nThe ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.\nOptical density has a definite connotation.  It is not the same as mass density. We have\nbeen using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually\nmeans  ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other.  The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer.  The speed of light is higher in a rarer\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\nNote from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive\nindex, is optically denser than water, although its mass density is less\nthan water.\nMaterial Refractive Material Refractive\nmedium index medium index\nAir 1.0003 Canada 1.53\nBalsam\nIce 1.31\nWater 1.33 Rock salt 1.54\nAlcohol 1.36\nKerosene 1.44 Carbon 1.63\ndisulphide\nFused 1.46\nquartz Dense 1.65\nflint glass\nTurpentine 1.47\noil Ruby 1.71\nBenzene 1.50\nSapphire 1.77\nCrown 1.52\nglass Diamond  2.42\nlight in air and v is the speed of light in the medium, then, the refractive\nindex of the medium nm is given by\nnm = Speed of light in air \nSpeed of light in the medium = c\nv (9.7)\nThe absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive\nindex. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From\nthe Table you can know that the r efractive index of water, nw = 1.33.\nThis means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of\nlight in water is equal to 1.33.  Similarly, the refractive index of crown\nglass, ng =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places.  However, you\nneed not memorise the data.\nTable 9.3 Absolute refractive index of some material media\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nScience150\n9.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses\nYou might have seen watchmakers using a small magnifying glass to\nsee tiny parts. Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass\nwith your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle\nor at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We\nshall discuss these in this section.\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both\nsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\nthat a lens is bound by at least one spherical\nsurface. In such lenses, the other surface would\nbe plane.  A lens may have two spherical\nsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\nalso called converging lenses.  Similarly, a double\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\nsurfaces, curved inwards.  It is thicker at the\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\nare also called diverging lenses. A double concave\nlens is simply called a concave lens.\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,\nhas two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces\nforms a part of a sphere. The centres of these\nspheres are called centres of curvature of the lens.\nThe centre of curvature of a lens is usually\nrepresented by the letter C.  Since there are two\ncentres of curvature, we may represent them as C1 and C2. An imaginary\nstraight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is\ncalled its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It is\nQUESTIONS\n?"

The effective\ndiameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.\nWe shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose\naperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of\ncurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are\ncalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays\nof light are incident on a lens?  Let us do an Activity to understand this.\nActivity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or through a lens while\ndoing this Activity or otherwise.

Obtain a sharp\nbright image of the Sun.\n/square6Hold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while.  Keep\nobserving the paper. What happened? Why? Recall your experience\nin Activity 9.2.\nThe paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fire\nafter a while.  Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutes\nparallel rays of light.  These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp\nbright spot formed on the paper.  In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a\nlens.  What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens.\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci.  They\nare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the\nposition of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the\napproximate focal length of the lens.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nScience152\n9.3.4 Image Formation by Lenses\nLenses form images by refracting light.

Note the change in the size\nof the image. What happens to the size of the image when the\ncandle is placed too far away from the lens.\nWhat conclusion can you draw from this Activity? A concave lens\nwill always give a virtual, erect and diminished image, irrespective of the\nposition of the object.\n9.3.5 Image Formation in Lenses Using Ray Diagrams\n We can represent image formation by lenses using ray diagrams. Ray\ndiagrams will also help us to study the nature, position and relative size\nof the image formed by lenses. For drawing ray diagrams in lenses, alike\nof spherical mirrors, we consider any two of the following rays –\n(i) A ray of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after\nrefraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focus\non the other side of the lens, as shown in Fig. 9.13 (a). In case of\na concave lens,\nthe ray appears\nto diverge from\nthe principal\nfocus located\non the same\nside of the lens,\nas shown in\nFig. 9.13 (b).\n(a) (b)\nTable 9.5 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens for various\npositions of the object\nPosition of the Position of Relative size of Nature of\nobject the image  the image the image\nAt infinity At focus F1 Highly diminished, Virtual and erect\npoint-sized\nBetween infinity and Between focus F 1 Diminished Virtual and erect\noptical centre O and optical centre O\nof the lens\nFigure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13Figure 9.13\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 21 ---\nScience154\n(ii) A ray of light passing\nthrough a principal\nfocus, after refraction\nfrom a convex lens, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nshown in Fig. 9.14 (a). A\nray of light appearing to\nmeet at the principal\nfocus of a concave lens,\nafter refraction, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nshown in Fig.9.14 (b).\n(iii) A ray of light passing\nthrough the optical\ncentre of a lens will\nemerge without any\ndeviation. This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.15(a)\nand Fig.9.15 (b).\n(b)(a)\n(b)(a)\nThe ray diagrams for the image formation in a convex lens for a few\npositions of the object are shown in Fig. 9.16. The ray diagrams\nrepresenting the image formation in a concave lens for various positions\nof the object are shown in Fig. 9.17.\nFigure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14Figure 9.14\nFigure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15Figure 9.15\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 22 ---\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 155\nFigure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16Figure 9.16  The position, size and the nature of the image formed by\na convex lens for various positions of the object\nFigure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Figure 9.17 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens\n9.3.6 Sign Convention for Spherical Lenses\nFor lenses, we follow sign convention, similar to the one used for spherical\nmirrors. We apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all\nmeasurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According\nto the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of\na concave lens is negative. Y ou must take car e to apply appropriate\nsigns for the values of u, v, f, object height h and image height h′.\n9.3.7 Lens Formula and Magnification\nAs we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula for\nspherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between object-\ndistance (u), image-distance (v) and the focal length (f ).  The lens formula\nis expressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f− = (9.8)\nThe lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situations\nfor any spherical lens. Take proper care of the signs of different quantities,\nwhile putting numerical values for solving problems relating to lenses.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 23 ---\nScience156\nMagnification\nThe magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for spherical\nmirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height\nof the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m . If h is the\nheight of the object and h\n′ is the height of the image given by a lens, then\nthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,\nm = Height of the Image\nHeight of the object = h\nh\n′ (9.9)\nMagnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance\nu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by\nMagnification (m ) = h′/h = v/u (9.10)\nExample 9.3\nA concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should\nthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.\nSolution\nA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\nof the object.\nImage-distance v = –10 cm;\nFocal length f = –15 cm;\nObject-distance u = ?\nSince \n1 1 1\nv u f− =\nor,\n1 1 1–u v f=\n( )\n1 1 1 1 1– ––10 –15 10 15u = = +\n1 3 2 1\n30 30u\n− += = −\nor,  u = – 30 cm\nThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.\nMagnification m = v/u\nm = −\n− = +10cm\n30cm\n1\n3 0.33;\nThe positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image\nis one-third of the size of the object.\nExample 9.4\nA 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the\nlens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also\nfind its magnification.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 24 ---\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 157\nSolution\nHeight of the object h = + 2.0 cm;\nFocal length f = + 10 cm;\nobject-distance u = –15 cm;\nImage-distance v = ?\nHeight of the image h′ = ?\nSince\n1 1 1\nv u f− =\nor,\n1 1 1\nv u f= +\n1 1 1 1 1\n( 15) 10 15 10v = + = − +−\n1 2 3 1\n30 30v\n− += =\nor, v = + 30 cm\nThe positive sign of v shows that the image is formed at a distance of\n30 cm on the other side of the optical centre.  The image is real and\ninverted.\nMagnification m = 'h v\nh u=\nor, h′ = h (v/u)\nHeight of the image, h′ = (2.0) (+30/–15) = – 4.0 cm\nMagnification m =  v/u\nor, 30cm 215cmm += = −−\nThe negative signs of m and h′ show that the image is inverted and\nreal. It is formed below the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image,\n4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the\nlens. The image is two times enlarged.\n9.3.8 Power of a Lens\nYou have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge\nlight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined\nas the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P.  The\npower P of a lens of focal length \nf is given by\nP = \n1\nf (9.11)\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 25 ---\nScience158\nThe SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.\nIf f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1 .\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\nconcave lens is negative.\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers.  Let us\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.  This means the lens\nprescribed is convex.  The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\na lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m.  The lens is concave.\nMany optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P ) of the lenses placed\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, …   as\nP = P1 + P2 + P3 + …\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses\nof known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates\nthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\nof two lenses of power  + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems\nto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.  Such a lens system,\nconsisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of\ncamera, microscopes and telescopes.\nQUESTIONS\n?"

In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the\norigin (Fig. 9.9).  The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis\n(X’X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –\n(i) The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies\nthat the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand\nside.\n(ii) All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the\npole of the mirror.\n(iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along\n+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of\nthe origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.\n(iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis\n(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.\n(v) Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis\n(along –y-axis) are taken as negative.\n2024-25",

These sign conventions are applied to obtain\nthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\n9.2.4  Mirror Formula and  Magnification\nIn a spherical mirror , the distance of the\nobject from its pole is called the object\ndistance (u).  The distance of the image from\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image\ndistance ( v). You alr eady know that the\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole\nis called the focal length ( f). There is a\nrelationship between these three quantities\ngiven by the mirr or for mula which is\nexpressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f+ = (9.1)\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the\nobject. You must use the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention while substituting numerical\nvalues for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula\nfor solving problems.\nMagnification\nMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to\nwhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\nIt is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the\nobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.\nIf h is the height of the object and h′ is the height of the image, then\nthe magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by\nm = \nHeight of the image ( )\nHeight of the object ( )\n′h\nh\nm = ′h\nh (9.2)\nThe magnification m is also related to the object distance ( u) and\nimage distance (v).  It can be expressed as:\nMagnification (m)  = ′ = −h\nh\nv\nu (9.3)\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis.  The height of the\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images.  However, it is to be\ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the\nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value\nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.\nFigure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9Figure 9.9\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\n2024-25",

This law is also known as Snell’s law of\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90o)\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\nsin\nsin\ni\nr  = constant (9.4)\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\nwith respect to the first.  Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1 .  In air, the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the r efractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11.  Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2.  The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21. This can be expressed in an equation form as\nn21=\nSpeed of light in medium 1 \nSpeed of light in medium 2 = v\nv\n1\n2\n(9.5)\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12. It is given\nby\nn12= Speed of light in medium 2 \nSpeed of light in medium 1 = v\nv\n2\n1\n(9.6)\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2\nis considered with respect to vacuum.  This is called the absolute refractive\nindex of the medium.  It is simply represented as n2. If c is the speed of\nFigure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11Figure 9.11\n2024-25",

It is not the same as mass density. We have\nbeen using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually\nmeans  ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other.  The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer.  The speed of light is higher in a rarer\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\nNote from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density.

Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a).

A ray of light through the optical\ncentre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective\ndiameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.\nWe shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose\naperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of\ncurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are\ncalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays\nof light are incident on a lens?  Let us do an Activity to understand this.\nActivity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11Activity 9.11\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or through a lens while\ndoing this Activity or otherwise.

Obtain a sharp\nbright image of the Sun.\n/square6Hold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while.  Keep\nobserving the paper. What happened? Why? Recall your experience\nin Activity 9.2.\nThe paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fire\nafter a while.  Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutes\nparallel rays of light.  These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp\nbright spot formed on the paper.  In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a\nlens.  What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens.\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci.  They\nare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the\nposition of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the\napproximate focal length of the lens.\n2024-25",

For drawing ray diagrams in lenses, alike\nof spherical mirrors, we consider any two of the following rays –\n(i) A ray of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after\nrefraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focus\non the other side of the lens, as shown in Fig. 9.13 (a).

We apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all\nmeasurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According\nto the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of\na concave lens is negative. Y ou must take car e to apply appropriate\nsigns for the values of u, v, f, object height h and image height h′.\n9.3.7 Lens Formula and Magnification\nAs we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula for\nspherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between object-\ndistance (u), image-distance (v) and the focal length (f ).  The lens formula\nis expressed as\n1 1 1\nv u f− = (9.8)\nThe lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situations\nfor any spherical lens. Take proper care of the signs of different quantities,\nwhile putting numerical values for solving problems relating to lenses.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 23 ---\nScience156\nMagnification\nThe magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for spherical\nmirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height\nof the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m . If h is the\nheight of the object and h\n′ is the height of the image given by a lens, then\nthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,\nm = Height of the Image\nHeight of the object = h\nh\n′ (9.9)\nMagnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance\nu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by\nMagnification (m ) = h′/h = v/u (9.10)\nExample 9.3\nA concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should\nthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.\nSolution\nA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\nof the object.\nImage-distance v = –10 cm;\nFocal length f = –15 cm;\nObject-distance u = ?\nSince \n1 1 1\nv u f− =\nor,\n1 1 1–u v f=\n( )\n1 1 1 1 1– ––10 –15 10 15u = = +\n1 3 2 1\n30 30u\n− += = −\nor,  u = – 30 cm\nThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.\nMagnification m = v/u\nm = −\n− = +10cm\n30cm\n1\n3 0.33;\nThe positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image\nis one-third of the size of the object.\nExample 9.4\nA 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the\nlens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also\nfind its magnification.\n2024-25",

The image is two times enlarged.\n9.3.8 Power of a Lens\nYou have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge\nlight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined\nas the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P.  The\npower P of a lens of focal length \nf is given by\nP = \n1\nf (9.11)\n2024-25",

        "content": "--- Page 25 ---\nScience158\nThe SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.\nIf f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1 .\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\nconcave lens is negative.\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers.  Let us\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.  This means the lens\nprescribed is convex.  The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\na lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m.  The lens is concave.\nMany optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P ) of the lenses placed\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, …   as\nP = P1 + P2 + P3 + …\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses\nof known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates\nthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\nof two lenses of power  + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems\nto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.  Such a lens system,\nconsisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of\ncamera, microscopes and telescopes.\nQUESTIONS\n?",

The\nmodes by which various organisms reproduce depend on the body\ndesign of the organisms.\n7.2.1 Fission\nFor unicellular organisms, cell division, or fission, leads to the creation\nof new individuals. Many different patterns of fission have been observed.\nMany bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during\ncell division. In organisms such as Amoeba, the splitting of the two cells\nduring division can take place in any plane.\nActivity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3\n/square6Observe a permanent slide of\nAmoeba under a microscope.\n/square6Similarly observe another\npermanent slide of Amoeba\nshowing binary fission.\n/square6Now, compare the observations of\nboth the slides.\nHowever, some unicellular or ganisms\nshow somewhat more organisation of their\nbodies, such as is seen in Leishmania (which\ncause kala-azar), which have a whip-like\nstructure at one end of the cell. In such\norganisms, binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation to\nFigure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)Figure 7.1(b)  Binary fission in Leishmania\n  (a)         (b)          (c)          (d)            (e)                        (f)\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nScience116\nthese structures. Other single-celled organisms, such as the malarial\nparasite, Plasmodium , divide into many daughter cells simultaneously\nby multiple fission.\nYeast, on the other hand, can put out small buds that separate and\ngrow further, as we saw in Activity 7.1.\n7.2.2 Fragmentation\nFigure 7.2Figure 7.2Figure 7.2Figure 7.2Figure 7.2\nMultiple fission in\nPlasmodium\nActivity 7.4Activity 7.4Activity 7.4Activity 7.4Activity 7.4\n/square6Collect water from a lake or pond that appears dark green and\ncontains filamentous structures.\n/square6Put one or two filaments on a slide.\n/square6Put a drop of glycerine on these filaments and cover it with a coverslip.\n/square6Observe the slide under a microscope.\n/square6Can you identify different tissues in the Spirogyra filaments?\nIn multi-cellular organisms with relatively simple body organisation,\nsimple reproductive methods can still work. Spirogyra, for example,\nsimply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation. These pieces or\nfragments grow into new individuals. Can we work out the reason for\nthis, based on what we saw in Activity 7.4?\nThis is not true for all multi-cellular organisms. They cannot simply\ndivide cell-by-cell. The reason is that many multi-cellular organisms, as\nwe have seen, are not simply a random collection of cells. Specialised\ncells are organised as tissues, and tissues are organised into organs,\nwhich then have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In such a\ncarefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical.\nMulti-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of\nreproduction.\nA basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different\ncell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general\npattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific\ncell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if\nthe organism itself consists of many cell types? The answer is that there\nmust be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing,\nproliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances.\n7.2.3 Regeneration\nMany fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new\nindividual organisms from their body parts. That is, if the individual is\nsomehow cut or broken up into many pieces, many of these pieces grow\ninto separate individuals. For example, simple animals like Hydra and\nPlanaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows\ninto a complete organism. This is known as regeneration (see Fig. 7.3).\nRegeneration is carried out by specialised cells. These cells proliferate\nand make large numbers of cells. From this mass of cells, different cells\nundergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. These changes\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 117\nFigure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Figure 7.3 Regeneration in Planaria\ntake place in an organised\nsequence referred to as\ndevelopment. However ,\nregeneration is not the same\nas reproduction, since most\norganisms would not\nnormally depend on being cut\nup to be able to reproduce.\n7.2.4 Budding\nOrganisms such as Hydra\nuse regenerative cells for\nreproduction in the process of\nbudding. In Hydra, a bud\ndevelops as an outgrowth due\nto repeated cell division at one\nspecific site (Fig. 7.4). These buds develop into tiny individuals and when\nfully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent\nindividuals.\nFigure 7.4Figure 7.4Figure 7.4Figure 7.4Figure 7.4  Budding in Hydra\n7.2.5 Vegetative Propagation\nThere are many plants in which parts like the root, stem and leaves\ndevelop into new plants under appropriate conditions. Unlike in most\nanimals, plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction. This\nproperty of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering\nor grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for\nagricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear\nflowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods\nalso make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange,\nrose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another\nadvantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are\ngenetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its\ncharacteristics.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nScience118\nSimilarly buds produced in the notches along the leaf\nmargin of Bryophyllum  fall on the soil and develop into\nnew plants (Fig. 7.5).\nActivity 7.6Activity 7.6Activity 7.6Activity 7.6Activity 7.6\n/square6Select a money-plant.\n/square6Cut some pieces such that they contain at least\none leaf.\n/square6Cut out some other portions between two leaves.\n/square6Dip one end of all the pieces in water and observe\nover the next few days.\n/square6Which ones grow and give rise to fresh leaves?\n/square6What can you conclude from your observations?\nTissue cultur e\nIn tissue culture, new plants are grown by removing tissue or separating cells from\nthe growing tip of a plant. The cells are then placed in an artificial medium where they\ndivide rapidly to form a small group of cells or callus. The callus is transferred to\nanother medium containing hormones for growth and differentiation. The plantlets\nare then placed in the soil so that they can grow into mature plants. Using tissue\nculture, many plants can be grown from one parent in disease-free conditions. This\ntechnique is commonly used for ornamental plants.\n7.2.6 Spore Formation\nEven in many simple multi-cellular organisms, specific reproductive\nparts can be identified. The thread-like structures that developed on\nthe bread in Activity 7.2 above are the hyphae of the bread mould\n(Rhizopus). They are not reproductive parts. On the other hand, the\ntiny blob-on-a-stick structures are involved in reproduction. The\nblobs are sporangia, which contain cells, or spores, that can\neventually develop into new Rhizopus individuals (Fig. 7.6). The spores\nare covered by thick walls that protect them until they come into\ncontact with another moist surface and can begin to grow.\nFigure 7.6Figure 7.6Figure 7.6Figure 7.6Figure 7.6\nSpore formation in Rhizopus\nActivity 7.5Activity 7.5Activity 7.5Activity 7.5Activity 7.5\n/square6Take a potato and observe its surface.

        "content": "7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\nWe are also familiar with modes of r eproduction that depend on the\ninvolvement of two individuals before a new generation can be created.\nBulls alone cannot produce new calves, nor can hens alone produce\nnew chicks. In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to\nproduce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode\nof reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of\nreproduction, which we have been discussing above?\n7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction?\nThe creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as\nwell as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we\nhave noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are\na source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual\norganism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,\nvariations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would\ntherefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes\nthat allowed more and more variation to be generated.\nWhile DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they\nare precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow\nprocess. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many\nof the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular\napparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants\nbe speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already\nhas variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two\ndifferent individuals in a population would have quite different patterns\nof accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living\nindividuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects.\nCombining variations from two or more individuals would thus create\nnew combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since\nit would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nScience120\nreproduction incorporates such a process of combining DNA from two\ndifferent individuals during reproduction.\nBut this creates a major difficulty. If each new generation is to be the\ncombination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then\neach new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that\nthe previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the\ncellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for\nsolving this difficulty?\nWe have seen earlier that as organisms become mor\ne complex, the\nspecialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular\norganisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special\nlineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of\nchromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-\nreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division\ncalled meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine\nduring sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-\nestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in\nthe new generation.\nIf the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has\nhighly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores\nof energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two\ngerm-cells are not very different from one another, or may even be similar.\nBut as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also\nspecialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the\nother is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-\ncell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored\nfood is called the female gamete. We shall see in the next few sections\nhow the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to\ndifferences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some\ncases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms.\n7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\nThe reproductive parts of angiosperms are located in the flower. You\nhave already studied the different parts of a flower – sepals, petals,\nstamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are\nthe reproductive parts of a flower which\ncontain the germ-cells.  What possible\nfunctions could the petals and sepals serve?\nThe flower may be unisexual (papaya,\nwatermelon) when it contains either stamens\nor pistil or bisexual ( Hibiscus, mustard)\nwhen it contains both stamens and pistil.\nStamen is the male reproductive part and it\nproduces pollen grains that are yellowish\nin colour. You must have seen this yellowish\npowder that often sticks to our hands if we\ntouch the stamen of a flower. Pistil is present\nin the centre of a flower and is the female\nreproductive part. It is made of three parts.\nFigure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7\nLongitudinal section of\nflower\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 121\nFigure 7.8Figure 7.8Figure 7.8Figure 7.8Figure 7.8\nGermination of pollen on\nstigma\nThe swollen bottom part is the ovary, middle elongated part is the style\nand the terminal part which may be sticky is the stigma. The ovary\ncontains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell\nproduced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in\nthe ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the\nzygote which is capable of growing into a new plant.\nThus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the\nstigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower , it is\nreferred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is\ntransferred fr om one flower to another , it is known as cr oss-\npollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is\nachieved by agents like wind, water or animals.\nAfter the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the\nfemale germ-cells which are in the ovary. For this, a tube grows\nout of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the\novary.\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote divides several times to form an\nembryo within the ovule. The ovule develops a tough coat and is\ngradually converted into a seed. The ovary grows rapidly and ripens\nto form a fruit. Meanwhile, the petals, sepals, stamens, style and\nstigma may shrivel and fall off. Have you ever observed any flower\npart still persisting in the fruit?

Let us now look at the species that we are most\ninterested in, namely, humans. Humans use a sexual mode of\nreproduction. How does this process work?\nLet us begin at an apparently unrelated point. All of us know that\nour bodies change as we become older. You have learnt changes that\ntake place in your body earlier in Class VIII also. W e notice that our\nheight has increased continuously fr\nom early age till now. We acquire\nteeth, we even lose the old, so-called milk teeth and acquire new ones.\nFigure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9\nGermination\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nScience122\nAll of these are changes that can be grouped under the general process\nof growth, in which the body becomes larger. But in early teenage years,\na whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as\nbody enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes.\nProportions change, new features appear, and so do new sensations.\nSome of these changes are common to both boys and girls. We begin\nto notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits\nand the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker\nin colour. Thinner hair can also appear on legs and arms, as well as on\nthe face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop\npimples. We begin to be conscious and aware of both our own bodies\nand those of others in new ways.\nOn the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are\ndifferent between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,\nwith darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,\ngirls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new\nthick hair growth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further,\nthe penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in\ndaydreams or at night.\nAll of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and\nyears. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do\nthey happen at an exact age. In some people, they happen early and\nquickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does\nnot become complete quickly either. So, for example, thick hair on the\nface in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does\nthe growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show\ndifferences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or\nfingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and\nshape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual\nmaturation of the body.\nWhy does the body show sexual maturation at this age? W e have\ntalked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies\nto carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate\nin sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen\nthat plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human\nbeings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However, while the\nbody of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources\nof the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is\nhappening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be\na major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow\ndown, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during\nadolescence is called puberty.\nSo how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the\nreproductive process? We must r emember that the sexual mode of\nreproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join\ntogether. This can happen by the external release of germ-cells from the\nbodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants. Or it can happen\nby two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of\ngerm-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 123\nparticipate in this process of mating, their state of sexual maturity must\nbe identifiable by other individuals. Many changes during puberty, such\nas new hair-growth patterns, are signals that sexual maturation is taking\nplace.\nOn the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two\npeople needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it\nis capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is\ncarried in the mother’s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed\nlater. The female reproductive organs and breasts will need to mature to\naccommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in\nthe process of sexual reproduction.\n7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System\nThe male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)\nconsists of portions which produce the\ngerm-cells and other portions that deliver\nthe germ-cells to the site of fertilisation.\nThe formation of germ-cells or sperms\ntakes place in the testes. These are located\noutside the abdominal cavity in scrotum\nbecause sperm formation requires a lower\ntemperature than the normal body\ntemperature. We have discussed the role of the\ntestes in the secretion of the hormone,\ntestosterone, in the pr evious chapter. In\naddition to regulating the formation of sperms,\ntestosterone brings about changes in\nappearance seen in boys at the time of puberty.\nThe sperms formed are delivered\nthrough the vas deferens which unites with\na tube coming from the urinary bladder. The\nurethra thus forms a common passage for\nboth the sperms and urine. Along the path\nof the vas deferens, glands like the prostate\nand the seminal vesicles add their secretions\nso that the sperms are now in a fluid which\nmakes their transport easier and this fluid\nalso provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny\nbodies that consist of mainly genetic\nmaterial and a long tail that helps them to\nmove towards the female germ-cell.\n7.3.3 (b) Female Reproductive System\nThe female germ-cells or eggs are made in\nthe ovaries. They are also responsible for the\nproduction of some hormones. Look at\nFig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in\nthe female reproductive system.\nFigure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Human– male reproductive system\nFigure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Human –female reproductive system\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nScience124\nWhen a girl is born, the ovaries already contain thousands of\nimmature eggs. On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One\negg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried\nfrom the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube.\nThe two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the\nuterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix.\nThe sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual\nintercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may\nencounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a\nball of cells or embryo. The embryo is implanted in the lining of the uterus\nwhere they continue to grow and develop organs to become foetus. We\nhave seen in earlier sections that the mother’s body is designed to\nundertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself\nevery month to receive and nurture the growing embryo. The lining\nthickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo.\nThe embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a\nspecial tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the\nuterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the\nmother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides\na large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to\nthe embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances\nwhich can be removed by transferring them into the mother’s blood\nthrough the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother’s\nbody takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus.\n7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not F ertilised?\nIf the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary\nreleases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month\nto receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy.\nThis would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had\ntaken place. Now, however, this lining is not needed any longer. So, the\nlining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and\nmucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as\nmenstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days.\n7.3.3 (d) Reproductive Health\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes\nplace while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree\nof sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the\nmind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children.\nHow do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major\nresponsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures\nabout these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for\nparticipating in many activities, whether we really want to or not. There\ncan be pressure from families to get married and start having children.\nThere can be pressure from government agencies to avoid having\nchildren. In this situation, making choices can become very difficult.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nHow do Organisms Reproduce? 125\nWe must also consider the possible health consequences of having\nsex. We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted\nfrom person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a\nvery intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many\ndiseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections\nsuch as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts\nand HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases\nduring the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis\nduring sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to\nsome extent.\nThe sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy.\nPregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the\nwoman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely\naffected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy.\nThese contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One\ncategory is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not\nreach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the\nvagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts\nby changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not\nreleased and fertilisation cannot occur . These drugs commonly need\nto be taken orally as pills. However , since they change hor monal\nbalances, they can cause side-effects too. Other contraceptive devices\nsuch as the loop or the copper -T are placed in the uterus to pr event\npregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the\nuterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will\nbe prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will\nnot be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take\nplace. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While\nsurgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause\ninfections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can\nalso be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be\nmisused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in\nillegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,\nthe female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless\nfemale foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in\nsome sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has\nbeen prohibited by law.\nWe have noted earlier that r eproduction is the pr\nocess by which\norganisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a\ngiven population will determine its size. The size of the human population\nis a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding\npopulation makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living.\nHowever, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of\nliving for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant.\nIf we look around us, what can we identify as the most important\nreason(s) for poor living standards?\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nScience126\nWhat you have learnt\n/square6Reproduction, unlike other life processes, is not essential to maintain the life of an\nindividual organism.\n/square6Reproduction involves creation of a DNA copy and additional cellular apparatus\nby the cell involved in the process.\n/square6Various organisms use different modes of reproduction depending on their body\ndesign.\n/square6In fission, many bacteria and protozoa simply divide into two or more daughter\ncells.\n/square6Organisms such as hydra can regenerate if they are broken into pieces.

Many different patterns of fission have been observed.\nMany bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during\ncell division. In organisms such as Amoeba, the splitting of the two cells\nduring division can take place in any plane.\nActivity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3Activity 7.3\n/square6Observe a permanent slide of\nAmoeba under a microscope.\n/square6Similarly observe another\npermanent slide of Amoeba\nshowing binary fission.\n/square6Now, compare the observations of\nboth the slides.\nHowever, some unicellular or ganisms\nshow somewhat more organisation of their\nbodies, such as is seen in Leishmania (which\ncause kala-azar), which have a whip-like\nstructure at one end of the cell.

Spirogyra, for example,\nsimply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation. These pieces or\nfragments grow into new individuals. Can we work out the reason for\nthis, based on what we saw in Activity 7.4?\nThis is not true for all multi-cellular organisms. They cannot simply\ndivide cell-by-cell. The reason is that many multi-cellular organisms, as\nwe have seen, are not simply a random collection of cells. Specialised\ncells are organised as tissues, and tissues are organised into organs,\nwhich then have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In such a\ncarefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical.\nMulti-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of\nreproduction.\nA basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different\ncell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general\npattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific\ncell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if\nthe organism itself consists of many cell types? The answer is that there\nmust be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing,\nproliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances.\n7.2.3 Regeneration\nMany fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new\nindividual organisms from their body parts. That is, if the individual is\nsomehow cut or broken up into many pieces, many of these pieces grow\ninto separate individuals. For example, simple animals like Hydra and\nPlanaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows\ninto a complete organism. This is known as regeneration (see Fig. 7.3).\nRegeneration is carried out by specialised cells. These cells proliferate\nand make large numbers of cells. From this mass of cells, different cells\nundergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. These changes\n2024-25",

In Hydra, a bud\ndevelops as an outgrowth due\nto repeated cell division at one\nspecific site (Fig. 7.4).

Unlike in most\nanimals, plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction. This\nproperty of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering\nor grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for\nagricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear\nflowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods\nalso make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange,\nrose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another\nadvantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are\ngenetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its\ncharacteristics.\n2024-25",

In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to\nproduce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode\nof reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of\nreproduction, which we have been discussing above?\n7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction?\nThe creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as\nwell as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we\nhave noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are\na source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual\norganism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,\nvariations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would\ntherefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes\nthat allowed more and more variation to be generated.\nWhile DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they\nare precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow\nprocess. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many\nof the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular\napparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants\nbe speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already\nhas variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two\ndifferent individuals in a population would have quite different patterns\nof accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living\nindividuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects.\nCombining variations from two or more individuals would thus create\nnew combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since\nit would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of\n2024-25",

If each new generation is to be the\ncombination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then\neach new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that\nthe previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the\ncellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for\nsolving this difficulty?\nWe have seen earlier that as organisms become mor\ne complex, the\nspecialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular\norganisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special\nlineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of\nchromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-\nreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division\ncalled meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine\nduring sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-\nestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in\nthe new generation.\nIf the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has\nhighly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores\nof energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two\ngerm-cells are not very different from one another, or may even be similar.\nBut as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also\nspecialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the\nother is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-\ncell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored\nfood is called the female gamete. We shall see in the next few sections\nhow the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to\ndifferences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some\ncases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms.\n7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\nThe reproductive parts of angiosperms are located in the flower. You\nhave already studied the different parts of a flower – sepals, petals,\nstamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are\nthe reproductive parts of a flower which\ncontain the germ-cells.  What possible\nfunctions could the petals and sepals serve?\nThe flower may be unisexual (papaya,\nwatermelon) when it contains either stamens\nor pistil or bisexual ( Hibiscus, mustard)\nwhen it contains both stamens and pistil.\nStamen is the male reproductive part and it\nproduces pollen grains that are yellowish\nin colour. You must have seen this yellowish\npowder that often sticks to our hands if we\ntouch the stamen of a flower. Pistil is present\nin the centre of a flower and is the female\nreproductive part. It is made of three parts.\nFigure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7\nLongitudinal section of\nflower\n2024-25",

The ovary\ncontains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell\nproduced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in\nthe ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the\nzygote which is capable of growing into a new plant.\nThus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the\nstigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower , it is\nreferred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is\ntransferred fr om one flower to another , it is known as cr oss-\npollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is\nachieved by agents like wind, water or animals.\nAfter the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the\nfemale germ-cells which are in the ovary. For this, a tube grows\nout of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the\novary.\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote divides several times to form an\nembryo within the ovule. The ovule develops a tough coat and is\ngradually converted into a seed. The ovary grows rapidly and ripens\nto form a fruit. Meanwhile, the petals, sepals, stamens, style and\nstigma may shrivel and fall off. Have you ever observed any flower\npart still persisting in the fruit? Try and work out the advantages\nof seed-formation for the plant. The seed contains the future plant\nor embryo which develops into a seedling under appropriate\nconditions.

Let us now look at the species that we are most\ninterested in, namely, humans. Humans use a sexual mode of\nreproduction. How does this process work?\nLet us begin at an apparently unrelated point. All of us know that\nour bodies change as we become older. You have learnt changes that\ntake place in your body earlier in Class VIII also. W e notice that our\nheight has increased continuously fr\nom early age till now. We acquire\nteeth, we even lose the old, so-called milk teeth and acquire new ones.\nFigure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9Figure 7.9\nGermination\n2024-25",

But in early teenage years,\na whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as\nbody enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes.\nProportions change, new features appear, and so do new sensations.\nSome of these changes are common to both boys and girls. We begin\nto notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits\nand the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker\nin colour. Thinner hair can also appear on legs and arms, as well as on\nthe face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop\npimples. We begin to be conscious and aware of both our own bodies\nand those of others in new ways.\nOn the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are\ndifferent between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,\nwith darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,\ngirls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new\nthick hair growth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further,\nthe penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in\ndaydreams or at night.\nAll of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and\nyears. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do\nthey happen at an exact age. In some people, they happen early and\nquickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does\nnot become complete quickly either. So, for example, thick hair on the\nface in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does\nthe growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show\ndifferences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or\nfingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and\nshape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual\nmaturation of the body.\nWhy does the body show sexual maturation at this age? W e have\ntalked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies\nto carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate\nin sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen\nthat plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human\nbeings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However, while the\nbody of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources\nof the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is\nhappening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be\na major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow\ndown, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during\nadolescence is called puberty.\nSo how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the\nreproductive process? We must r emember that the sexual mode of\nreproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join\ntogether. This can happen by the external release of germ-cells from the\nbodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants. Or it can happen\nby two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of\ngerm-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to\n2024-25",

Many changes during puberty, such\nas new hair-growth patterns, are signals that sexual maturation is taking\nplace.\nOn the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two\npeople needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it\nis capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is\ncarried in the mother’s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed\nlater. The female reproductive organs and breasts will need to mature to\naccommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in\nthe process of sexual reproduction.\n7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System\nThe male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)\nconsists of portions which produce the\ngerm-cells and other portions that deliver\nthe germ-cells to the site of fertilisation.\nThe formation of germ-cells or sperms\ntakes place in the testes. These are located\noutside the abdominal cavity in scrotum\nbecause sperm formation requires a lower\ntemperature than the normal body\ntemperature. We have discussed the role of the\ntestes in the secretion of the hormone,\ntestosterone, in the pr evious chapter. In\naddition to regulating the formation of sperms,\ntestosterone brings about changes in\nappearance seen in boys at the time of puberty.\nThe sperms formed are delivered\nthrough the vas deferens which unites with\na tube coming from the urinary bladder. The\nurethra thus forms a common passage for\nboth the sperms and urine. Along the path\nof the vas deferens, glands like the prostate\nand the seminal vesicles add their secretions\nso that the sperms are now in a fluid which\nmakes their transport easier and this fluid\nalso provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny\nbodies that consist of mainly genetic\nmaterial and a long tail that helps them to\nmove towards the female germ-cell.\n7.3.3 (b) Female Reproductive System\nThe female germ-cells or eggs are made in\nthe ovaries. They are also responsible for the\nproduction of some hormones. Look at\nFig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in\nthe female reproductive system.\nFigure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Human– male reproductive system\nFigure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Human –female reproductive system\n2024-25",

        "content": "--- Page 12 ---\nScience124\nWhen a girl is born, the ovaries already contain thousands of\nimmature eggs. On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One\negg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried\nfrom the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube.\nThe two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the\nuterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix.\nThe sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual\nintercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may\nencounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a\nball of cells or embryo. The embryo is implanted in the lining of the uterus\nwhere they continue to grow and develop organs to become foetus. We\nhave seen in earlier sections that the mother’s body is designed to\nundertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself\nevery month to receive and nurture the growing embryo. The lining\nthickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo.\nThe embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a\nspecial tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the\nuterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the\nmother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides\na large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to\nthe embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances\nwhich can be removed by transferring them into the mother’s blood\nthrough the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother’s\nbody takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus.\n7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not F ertilised?\nIf the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary\nreleases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month\nto receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy.\nThis would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had\ntaken place. Now, however, this lining is not needed any longer. So, the\nlining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and\nmucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as\nmenstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days.\n7.3.3 (d) Reproductive Health\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes\nplace while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree\nof sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the\nmind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children.\nHow do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major\nresponsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures\nabout these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for\nparticipating in many activities, whether we really want to or not. There\ncan be pressure from families to get married and start having children.\nThere can be pressure from government agencies to avoid having\nchildren. In this situation, making choices can become very difficult.\n2024-25",

We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted\nfrom person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a\nvery intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many\ndiseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections\nsuch as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts\nand HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases\nduring the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis\nduring sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to\nsome extent.\nThe sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy.\nPregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the\nwoman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely\naffected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy.\nThese contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One\ncategory is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not\nreach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the\nvagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts\nby changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not\nreleased and fertilisation cannot occur . These drugs commonly need\nto be taken orally as pills. However , since they change hor monal\nbalances, they can cause side-effects too. Other contraceptive devices\nsuch as the loop or the copper -T are placed in the uterus to pr event\npregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the\nuterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will\nbe prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will\nnot be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take\nplace. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While\nsurgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause\ninfections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can\nalso be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be\nmisused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in\nillegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,\nthe female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless\nfemale foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in\nsome sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has\nbeen prohibited by law.\nWe have noted earlier that r eproduction is the pr\nocess by which\norganisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a\ngiven population will determine its size. The size of the human population\nis a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding\npopulation makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living.\nHowever, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of\nliving for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant.\nIf we look around us, what can we identify as the most important\nreason(s) for poor living standards?\n2024-25",

Let us consider the analogy of\nflow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference –\nalong the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.\nWe define the electric potential difference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other –\nPotential differ\nence (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)\nV = W/Q (11.2)\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandro Volta (1745– 1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the\npotential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor\nwhen 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one\npoint to the other.\nTherefore, 1 volt = \n1 joule\n1 coulomb\n(11.3)\n1 V  = 1 J C–1\nThe potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called\nthe voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the\npoints between which the potential difference is to be measured.\nExample 11.2\nHow much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points\nhaving a potential difference 12 V?\nSolution\nThe amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential\ndifference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in\nmoving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nScience174\nW = VQ\n= 12 V × 2 C\n= 24 J.\nQUESTIONS\n?\n11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM11.3 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM\nWe know that an electric circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.1, comprises a cell\n(or a battery), a plug key, electrical component(s), and connecting wires.\nIt is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which different\ncomponents of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently\nused.

A\nstraight line plot shows that as the\ncurrent through a wire increases, the\npotential difference across the wire\nincreases linearly – this is Ohm’s law.\nActivity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2\n/square6Take a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 – 5 A range), a plug\nkey and some connecting wires.\n/square6Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter\nleaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.4.\nIn this Activity, you will find that approximately the\nsame value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V–I\ngraph is a straight line that passes through the origin of\nthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, \nV/I is a constant\nratio.\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm\n(1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference\nacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the\nends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its\ntemperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In\nother words –\nV ∝  I (11.4)\nor V/I = constant\n= R\nor V = IR (11.5)\nIn Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges  through it. Its SI\nunit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Ω . According to Ohm’s law,\nR = V/I (11.6)\nIf the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V\nand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor\nis 1 Ω . That is, 1 ohm = \n1 volt\n1 ampere\nAlso from Eq. (11.5) we get\nI = V/R (11.7)\nIt is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is\ninversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the\ncurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable\nresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to\nchange the resistance in the circuit. We will now study about electrical\nresistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nElectricity 177\nIn this Activity we observe that the current is different for different\ncomponents. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path\nfor the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know\nthat motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric\ncurrent. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a\nconductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among\nwhich they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is\nretarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low\nresistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable\nresistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a\nhigher resistance is a poor conductor. An insulator of the same size offers\neven higher resistance.\n11.5 FA11.5 FA11.5 FA\n11.5 FA11.5 FA CTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTCTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST ANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF AANCE OF A\nCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDSCONDUCTOR DEPENDS\nFigure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4Figure 11.4\n/square6Complete the cir cuit by connecting the nichr ome wir e in the gap XY .

Analyse the observations.\nActivity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3Activity 11.3\n/square6Complete an electric cir cuit consisting of a cell, an ammeter , a nichrome wir e of length l\n[say, marked (1)]  \nand a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.5.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nScience178\nIt is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when\nthe length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when\na thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the\ncircuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different\nmaterial of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.\nOn applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (11.5) – (11.7)], we observe that the\nresistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of\ncross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements\nhave shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly\nproportional to its length (l ) and inversely proportional to the area of\ncross-section (A). That is,\nR ∝  l (11.8)\nand R ∝  1/A (11.9)\nCombining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we get\nR ∝  l\nA\nor, R = ρ l\nA (11.10)\nwhere ρ (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical\nresistivity of the material of the conductor. The SI unit of resistivity is\nΩ  m. It is a characteristic property of the material.

They are\ngood conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have\nresistivity of the order of 10 12 to 10 17 Ω  m. Both the resistance and\nresistivity of a material vary with temperature.\nTable 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher\nthan that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily\nat high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in\nelectrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used\nalmost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and\naluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.\nTable 11.2 Electrical resistivity* of some substances at 20°C\nMaterial Resistivity ( ΩΩΩ\nΩΩ  m)\nConductors Silver 1.60 × 10–8\nCopper 1.62 × 10–8\nAluminium 2.63 × 10–8\nTungsten 5.20 × 10–8\nNickel 6.84 × 10–8\nIron 10.0 × 10–8\nChromium 12.9 × 10–8\nMercury 94.0 × 10–8\nManganese 1.84 × 10–6\nAlloys Constantan 49 × 10–6\n(alloy of Cu and Ni)\nManganin 44 × 10–6\n(alloy of Cu, Mn and Ni)\nNichrome 100 × 10–6\n(alloy of Ni, Cr, Mn and Fe)\nInsulators Glass 1010 – 1014\nHard rubber 1013 – 1016\nEbonite 1015 – 1017\nDiamond 1012 - 1013\nPaper (dry) 1012\n* You need not memorise these values.

If the\ndiameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the\nmetal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the material\nof the wire.\nSolution\nWe are given the resistance R of the wir\ne = 26 Ω , the diameter\nd = 0.3 mm = 3 × 10 -4 m, and the length l of the wire = 1 m.\nTherefore, from Eq. (11.10), the resistivity of the given metallic wire is\nρ =  (RA/l)  =  (Rπ d2/4l )\nSubstitution of values in this gives\nρ =  1.84 × 10–6  Ω  m\nThe resistivity of the metal at 20°C is 1.84 × 10 –6  Ω  m.

We\nhave noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its\nresistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical\ngadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. We now therefore\nintend to see how Ohm’s law can be applied to combinations of resistors.\nThere are two methods of joining the resistors together. Figure 11.6\nshows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R1,\nR2 and R3, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said\nto be connected in series.\nFigure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6Figure 11.6  Resistors in series\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nScience182\nFigure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7Figure 11.7  Resistors in parallel\nYou will observe that the value of the current in the ammeter is the\nsame, independent of its position in the electric circuit.

Connect them\nwith a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.6.\nYou may use the r esistors of values like 1 Ω , 2 Ω , 3 Ω  etc., and a\nbattery of 6 V for performing this Activity.\n/square6Plug the key.

What would be their equivalent\nresistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the following\nactivities.\nFigure 11.7 shows a combination of resistors in which three resistors\nare connected together between points X and Y.

Now insert\nthe voltmeter acr oss the ends X and P of the first r esistor, as\nshown in Fig. 11.8.\nFigure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8Figure 11.8\n/square6Plug the key and measure the potential difference across the first\nresistor. Let it be V1.\n/square6Similarly, measure the potential difference across the other two\nresistors, separately. Let these values be V2 and V 3, respectively.\n/square6Deduce a relationship between V, V1, V2 and V3.\nYou will observe that the potential difference V is equal to the sum of\npotential differences V1, V2, and V3. That is the total potential difference\nacross a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential\ndifference across the individual resistors. That is,\nV = V1 + V2  + V3 (11.11)\nIn the electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.8, let I be the current through\nthe circuit. The current through each resistor is also I. It is possible to\nreplace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor\nof resistance \nR, such that the potential difference V across it, and the\ncurrent I through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm’s law\nto the entire circuit, we have\nV = I R (11.12)\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nScience184\nOn applying Ohm’s law to the three resistors separately, we further\nhave\nV1 = I R1 [11.13(a)]\nV2 = I R2 [11.13(b)]\nand V3 = I R3 [11.13(c)]\nFrom Eq. (11.11),\nI R = I R1 + I R2 + I R3\nor\nRs = R1 +R2 + R3 (11.14)\nWe can conclude that when several resistors are joined in series, the\nresistance of the combination R s equals the sum of their individual\nresistances, R1, R2, R3, and is thus greater than any individual resistance.\nExample 11.7\nAn electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 Ω , and a conductor of 4 Ω\nresistance are connected to a 6 V battery (Fig. 11.9). Calculate (a) the\ntotal resistance of the circuit, (b) the current through the circuit, and (c)\nthe potential difference across the electric lamp and conductor.\nSolution\nThe resistance of electric lamp, R1 = 20 Ω ,\nThe resistance of the conductor connected in series, R2 = 4 Ω .\nThen the total resistance in the circuit\nR = R1 + R2\nRs = 20 Ω\n + 4 Ω = 24 Ω .\nThe total potential difference across the two terminals of the battery\nV = 6 V.\nNow by Ohm’s law, the current through the circuit is given by\nI = V/Rs\n= 6 V/24 Ω\n= 0.25 A.\nFigure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9Figure 11.9  An electric lamp connected in series with\na resistor of 4 Ω  to a 6 V battery\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nElectricity 185\nApplying Ohm’s law to the electric lamp and conductor separately,\nwe get potential difference across the electric lamp,\nV1 = 20 Ω ×  0.25 A\n= 5 V;\nand,\nthat across the conductor, V2  =  4 Ω  ×  0.25 A\n         =  1 V.\nSuppose that we like to replace the series combination of electric\nlamp and conductor by a single and equivalent resistor. Its resistance\nmust be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery\nterminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance\nR of this equivalent resistor would be\nR = V/I\n= 6 V/ 0.25 A\n= 24 Ω .\nThis is the total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sum\nof the two resistances.\nQUESTIONS\n?"

By applying Ohm’s law to the parallel combination of resistors,\nwe have\nI = V/Rp (11.16)\nOn applying Ohm’s law to each resistor, we have\nI1 = V /R1;    I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3 (11.17)\nFrom Eqs.

Calculate\n(a) the total resistance in the circuit, and (b) the total current flowing\nin the circuit.\nSolution\nSuppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by an\nequivalent resistor of resistance, R\n′. Similarly we replace\nthe parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single\nresistor of resistance R″ . Then using Eq. (11.18), we have\n1/ R′ = 1/10 + 1/40 = 5/40; that is R′  = 8 Ω .\nSimilarly, 1/ R″ = 1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60;\nthat is, R″   = 10 Ω .\nThus, the total resistance, R = R′ + R″  = 18 Ω.\nTo calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get\n I = V/R = 12 V/18 Ω = 0.67 A.\nWe have seen that in a series cir cuit the curr ent is constant\nthroughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to\nconnect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they\nneed currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example\n11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one\ncomponent fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.\nIf you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on\nmarriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending\nlot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has\nto be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel\ncircuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total\nresistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is\nhelpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and\nrequires different current to operate properly.\nFigure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12\nAn electric circuit showing\nthe combination of series\nand parallel resistors\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nScience188\n11.7 HEA 11.7 HEA11.7 HEA11.7 HEA11.7 HEA TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENTTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT\nWe know that a battery or a cell is a sour ce of electrical energy. The\nchemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between\nits two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current\nthrough a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We\nhave also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source\nhas to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of\nthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into\nuseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the\nsource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of\ngadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating\neffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater, electric iron etc.\nConsider a current \nI flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let\nthe potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply\nenergy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the\nsource is\nP V VI =Q\nt = (11.19)\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P ×\n t,\nthat is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This\nenergy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady\ncurrent I, the amount of heat H produced in time t is\nH = VIt (11.20)\nQUESTIONS\n?"

(11.5)], we get\nH = I2 Rt (11.21)\nThis is known as Joule’s law of heating. The\nlaw implies that heat produced in a resistor is\n(i) directly proportional to the square of current\nfor a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to\nresistance for a given current, and (iii) directly\nproportional to the time for which the current flows\nthrough the resistor. In practical situations, when\nan electric appliance is connected to a known\nvoltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after\ncalculating the current through it, using the\nrelation I = V/R.\nExample 11.10\nAn electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is\nat the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum.\nThe voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the resistance in each\ncase?\nSolution\nFrom Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is\nP = V I\nThus the current I = P/V\n(a) When heating is at the maximum rate,\nI = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω.\n(b) When heating is at the minimum rate,\nI = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 Ω.\nExample 11.11\n100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Ω resistance.

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.\nHowever, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications.\nThe electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating.\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.\nAnother common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead\netc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A\nfuse must be used.\nQUESTIONS\n?"

This is also the rate of consumption of energy.\nEquation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated\nor consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power.\nThe power P is given by\nP  =  VI\nOr P  =  I2R = V2/R (11.22)\nThe SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by\na device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference\nof 1 V. Thus,\n       1 W  =  1 volt ×  1 ampere = 1 V A (11.23)\nThe unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a\nmuch larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical\nenergy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,\ntherefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when\n1 watt of power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric energy\nis kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.\n1 kW h = 1000 watt × 3600 second\n= 3.6 × 106 watt second\n= 3.6 × 106 joule (J)\nMore to Know!\nMany people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit. This is wrong!\nWe pay the electricity board or electric company to provide energy to move electrons\nthrough the electric gadgets like electric bulb, fan and engines. We pay for the energy\nthat we use.\nExample 11.12\nAn electric bulb is connected to a 220 V generator. The current is\n0.50 A. What is the power of the bulb?\nSolution\nP = VI\n= 220 V ×  0.50 A\n= 110 J/s\n= 110 W.\nExample 11.13\nAn electric refrigerator rated 400 W operates 8 hour/day. What is\nthe cost of the energy to operate it for 30 days at Rs 3.00 per kW h?\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 22 ---\nScience192\nQUESTIONS\n?"

Let us consider the analogy of\nflow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference –\nalong the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.\nWe define the electric potential difference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other –\nPotential differ\nence (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)\nV = W/Q (11.2)\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandro Volta (1745– 1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the\npotential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor\nwhen 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one\npoint to the other.\nTherefore, 1 volt = \n1 joule\n1 coulomb\n(11.3)\n1 V  = 1 J C–1\nThe potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called\nthe voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the\npoints between which the potential difference is to be measured.\nExample 11.2\nHow much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points\nhaving a potential difference 12 V?\nSolution\nThe amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential\ndifference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in\nmoving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is\n2024-25",

A\nstraight line plot shows that as the\ncurrent through a wire increases, the\npotential difference across the wire\nincreases linearly – this is Ohm’s law.\nActivity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2Activity 11.2\n/square6Take a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 – 5 A range), a plug\nkey and some connecting wires.\n/square6Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter\nleaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.4.\nIn this Activity, you will find that approximately the\nsame value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V–I\ngraph is a straight line that passes through the origin of\nthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, \nV/I is a constant\nratio.\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm\n(1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference\nacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the\nends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its\ntemperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In\nother words –\nV ∝  I (11.4)\nor V/I = constant\n= R\nor V = IR (11.5)\nIn Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges  through it. Its SI\nunit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Ω . According to Ohm’s law,\nR = V/I (11.6)\nIf the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V\nand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor\nis 1 Ω . That is, 1 ohm = \n1 volt\n1 ampere\nAlso from Eq. (11.5) we get\nI = V/R (11.7)\nIt is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is\ninversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the\ncurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable\nresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to\nchange the resistance in the circuit. We will now study about electrical\nresistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.\n2024-25",

Certain components offer an easy path\nfor the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know\nthat motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric\ncurrent. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a\nconductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among\nwhich they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is\nretarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low\nresistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable\nresistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a\nhigher resistance is a poor conductor.

The ammeter reading is increased when\na thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the\ncircuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different\nmaterial of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.\nOn applying Ohm’s law [Eqs.

Precise measurements\nhave shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly\nproportional to its length (l ) and inversely proportional to the area of\ncross-section (A).

Both the resistance and\nresistivity of a material vary with temperature.\nTable 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher\nthan that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily\nat high temperatures.

(11.18), we have\n1/ R′ = 1/10 + 1/40 = 5/40; that is R′  = 8 Ω .\nSimilarly, 1/ R″ = 1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60;\nthat is, R″   = 10 Ω .\nThus, the total resistance, R = R′ + R″  = 18 Ω.\nTo calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get\n I = V/R = 12 V/18 Ω = 0.67 A.\nWe have seen that in a series cir cuit the curr ent is constant\nthroughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to\nconnect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they\nneed currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example\n11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one\ncomponent fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.\nIf you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on\nmarriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending\nlot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has\nto be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel\ncircuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total\nresistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is\nhelpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and\nrequires different current to operate properly.\nFigure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12Figure 11.12\nAn electric circuit showing\nthe combination of series\nand parallel resistors\n2024-25",

The\nchemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between\nits two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current\nthrough a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We\nhave also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source\nhas to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of\nthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into\nuseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the\nsource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of\ngadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating\neffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater, electric iron etc.\nConsider a current \nI flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let\nthe potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply\nenergy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the\nsource is\nP V VI =Q\nt = (11.19)\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P ×\n t,\nthat is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This\nenergy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady\ncurrent I, the amount of heat H produced in time t is\nH = VIt (11.20)\nQUESTIONS\n?",

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.\nHowever, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications.\nThe electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating.\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.\nAnother common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead\netc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A\nfuse must be used.\nQUESTIONS\n?",

This is also the rate of consumption of energy.\nEquation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated\nor consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power.\nThe power P is given by\nP  =  VI\nOr P  =  I2R = V2/R (11.22)\nThe SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by\na device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference\nof 1 V. Thus,\n       1 W  =  1 volt ×  1 ampere = 1 V A (11.23)\nThe unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a\nmuch larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical\nenergy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,\ntherefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when\n1 watt of power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric energy\nis kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.\n1 kW h = 1000 watt × 3600 second\n= 3.6 × 106 watt second\n= 3.6 × 106 joule (J)\nMore to Know!\nMany people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit. This is wrong!\nWe pay the electricity board or electric company to provide energy to move electrons\nthrough the electric gadgets like electric bulb, fan and engines. We pay for the energy\nthat we use.\nExample 11.12\nAn electric bulb is connected to a 220 V generator. The current is\n0.50 A. What is the power of the bulb?\nSolution\nP = VI\n= 220 V ×  0.50 A\n= 110 J/s\n= 110 W.\nExample 11.13\nAn electric refrigerator rated 400 W operates 8 hour/day.

The SI unit of resistance is ohm (Ω).\n/square6Ohm’s law: The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly\nproportional to the current through it, provided its temperature remains the same.\n/square6The resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length, inversely on its area of\ncross-section, and also on the material of the conductor.\n/square6The equivalent resistance of several resistors in series is equal to the sum of\ntheir individual resistances.\n/square6A set of resistors connected in parallel has an equivalent resistance \nRp given by\n1 2 3\n1 1 1 1 ...\npR R R R= + + +\n/square6The electrical energy dissipated in a resistor is given by\nW = V × I ×  t\n/square6The unit of power is watt (W). One watt of power is consumed when 1 A of current\nflows at a potential difference of 1 V.\n/square6The commercial unit of electrical energy is kilowatt hour (kWh).\n1 kW h = 3,600,000 J = 3.6 ×\n 106 J.\nSolution\nThe total energy consumed by the refrigerator in 30 days would be\n400 W × 8.0 hour/day × 30 days = 96000 W h\n= 96 kW h\nThus the cost of energy to operate the refrigerator for 30 days is\n96 kW h ×  Rs 3.00 per kW h = Rs 288.00\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 23 ---\nElectricity 193\nEXERCISES",

Reactions in which heat is\nreleased along with the formation of products are called exothermic\nchemical reactions.\nOther examples of exothermic reactions are –\n(i) Burning of natural gas\nCH4(g) + 2O2 (g) →  CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g) (1.17)\n(ii) Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?\nWe all know that we need ener gy to stay alive. We get this energy\nfrom the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler\nsubstances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain\ncarbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.\nThis glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides\nenergy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of\nwhich you will study in Chapter 6.\nC6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(aq) →  6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy (1.18)\n(Glucose)\n(iii) The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an\nexample of an exothermic reaction.\nIdentify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where\nheat is given out along with the formation of a single product.\nDo You Know?\nA solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction 1.13 is used for whitewashing\nwalls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin\nlayer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is  formed after two to\nthree days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note\nthat the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.\nCa(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) → CaCO3(s)  + H2O(l) (1.14)\n(Calcium (Calcium\nhydroxide) carbonate)\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nScience8 88 88\nFigure 1.5\nHeating of lead nitrate and\nemission of nitrogen dioxide\nFigure 1.4\nCorrect way of heating\nthe boiling tube\ncontaining crystals\nof ferrous sulphate\nand of smelling the\nodour\nActivity 1.6Activity 1.6Activity 1.6Activity 1.6Activity 1.6\nn Take about 2 g lead nitrate powder in a boiling\ntube.\nn Hold the boiling tube with a pair of tongs and\nheat it over a flame, as shown in Fig. 1.5.\nn What do you observe?

This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous\nsulphate crystals (FeSO4. 7H2O) lose water when heated and the colour\nof the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe 2O3),\nsulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Ferric oxide is a solid,\nwhile SO2 and SO3 are gases.\nDecomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon\ndioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in\nvarious industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has\nmany uses – one is in the manufacture of cement.

The  white precipitate of BaSO4 is formed by the\nreaction of \n2–\n4SO  and Ba2+. The other product formed is sodium chloride\nwhich remains in the solution.

If a substance loses\noxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.\nQUESTIONS\n?"

This process\nis commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get\ntarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating\nformed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances\naround it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this\nprocess is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green\ncoating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships\nand to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of\niron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is\nspent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in\nChapter 3.\n1.3.2 Rancidity\nHave you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left\nfor a long time?\nWhen fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell\nand taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation\n(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food\nin air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that\nchips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as\nnitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?\nRecall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1Recall Activity 1.1 ,     where a magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling flame in air (oxygen)\nand changes into a white substance, magnesium oxide.

The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of\nwhich you will study in Chapter 6.\nC6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(aq) →  6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy (1.18)\n(Glucose)\n(iii) The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an\nexample of an exothermic reaction.\nIdentify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where\nheat is given out along with the formation of a single product.\nDo You Know?\nA solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction 1.13 is used for whitewashing\nwalls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin\nlayer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is  formed after two to\nthree days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note\nthat the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.\nCa(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) → CaCO3(s)  + H2O(l) (1.14)\n(Calcium (Calcium\nhydroxide) carbonate)\n2024-25",

This process\nis commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get\ntarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating\nformed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances\naround it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this\nprocess is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green\ncoating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships\nand to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of\niron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is\nspent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in\nChapter 3.\n1.3.2 Rancidity\nHave you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left\nfor a long time?\nWhen fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell\nand taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation\n(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food\nin air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation.

In the term judo, ‘ju’ means \n‘gentle’ and ‘do’ means ‘the way or path’.  \nJudo was developed in Japan in the late 19th \ncentury by using the principles of balance and \nleverage adapted from jujutsu. Its most prominent \nfeature is its competitive element, where the \nobjective is to either throw or putdown one’s \nopponent to the ground, immobilise or otherwise \nsubdue one’s opponent with a grappling maneuver, \nor force an opponent to submit by joint locking or \nby executing a stranglehold or choke. Strikes and \nthrusts by hands and feet as well as self-defense \nare a part of judo. Many are trained in Judo either \nfor participation in competition or self-defense.\nHistory\nThe history of judo starts with Japanese jujutsu. It was \ncreated by Professor Jigoro Kano and he believed that the \ntechniques could be practiced as a competitive sport if the \nmore dangerous techniques were omitted. By 1910 Judo was \na recognised sport that could be safely engaged in and in \n1911 it was adopted as a part of Japan’s educational system. \nIn the same year, the Kodokan Judo Instructors’ Training \nDepartment, Kodokan Black Belt Association and Japan \nAthletic Association were formed. World War II saw a different \ndevelopment of Judo. Instead of being used for sport, Judo was \nbeing taught as a combat skill. Those selected for commando \nand special services training often achieved a high standard \nof expertise. When Japan hosted the 1964 Olympics, Judo \nwas given its first opportunity as an event. Of the 16 medals \nawarded for Judo, Japan won three gold medals, and one \nsilver medal. Judo was no longer a Japanese sport but had \ndeveloped to become an international sport. \nThere have been two main developments in Judo over the \nyears. The first was the introduction of weight categories. \nEarlier everyone fought everyone else, with the result that, \nif two players were equally matched in skill, the bigger man \nusually won. Initially there were three categories, and later \nthis was made into five. Inclusion of the sport in the Olympic \nGames in 1964 helped to hasten this important reform.  \nThere are different styles of Judo. With its inclusion in the \nOlympics, there has been a shift towards a contest style \npractice. In clubs where this style is taught, the practice \nbecomes largely a continuous contest. Other schools stress \non skills. They favour repetitive movements to make them \ninstinctive and the development of speed through practice \nwith little resistance. \nFig. 7.5: Player playing Judo\nChap-7.indd   122 8/24/2020   11:41:04 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs II\n123\nRules\nOfficials\nThere are three officials who preside over a judo match. There \nis one referee who walks around inside the contest area and \nconducts the match. There are two judges who sit diagonally \nacross the mat from one another, each in a corner. The two \njudges assist the referee and indicate when the contestant \ngoes outside of the contest area. The referee is in charge \nof awarding points and accessing penalties and uses hand \ngestures to signal his decision. However, if a judge disagrees \nwith a call, then the three officials take a vote and the decision \nis decided by a majority vote. In addition to the Judge and \nReferees there are also scorekeepers and timers. There is \nusually a scoreboard, which displays points and penalties \nand it can either be electronic or manual. Medical personnel \nare also on hand in the event of injury to a contestant. \nContestants\nThe two contestants, who are known as Judokas, compete for \n5 minutes for men and 4 minutes for women. One contestant \nwears white uniform and the other a blue uniform. \nUniforms\nThe judokas wear loose-fitting judo uniforms called judogi, \nconsisting of pants, a jacket and a belt. Judogi is made up \nof loose-fitting pants, a jacket and a belt that is tied around \nthe waist. The jacket and pants are made of cotton. They \nare either blue or white and they are made so a rival should \nbe able to get a grip on either one of them so as to be able \nto make a judo throw. One judoka will wear white the other \nblue. The belt is three meters long and it is wrapped around \nthe waist twice. The color of the belt signifies the rank the \ncombatant has reached. \nCompetition area\nThe entire competition area in judo is 46 to 53 feet square  \n(14 to 16 meters). This area is made up of foam mats \ncommonly referred to as tatami mats and the individual \nmats are 6.5 feet by 3.281 feet wide (2 meters long, a 1-meter \nwide). Inside the competition area is a contest area, which \nis 8-10 meters square. This contest area (shiaijo) is green in \ncolor, that would be 29.5 feet square (9-meters) and it will \nhave a 3.281 foot (1-meter) red boundary around it. This is \nthe danger zone and it alerts the competitor(s) (judoka) that \nthey are about to go out of bounds. The area outside the \ndanger zone is the safety zone. This zone is three meters wide \nand it is the out-of-bounds area.\nChap-7.indd   123 8/24/2020   11:41:04 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n124\nIn the middle of the contest area are two pieces of tape, \none blue and one white 13.1 feet apart (4-meters). These two \npieces of tape mark the place where the judoka will stand \nwhen they begin and end each bout.\nContest\nA random draw, in the same weight category, is used to \ndetermine which contestants will be fighting each other. In \nthe Olympic Games there are two pools, and each pool has \nits own single-elimination tournament. The two pool winners \nwill compete for the gold medal, with the loser of this contest \nwinning the silver medal. In each pool, the competitors who \nlose to a pool winner are then entered into a repechage round \nwhich is also a single-elimination tournament. The winners of \nthe repechage pools will be the winners of the bronze medals.\nTo win the contest a Judoka must score an Ippon a score \nthat equals 10 points by using successful Judo techniques. \nIf neither of the Judokas is able to score an Ippon or 10 \npoints by the end of the match, the winner will be the Judoka \nwho has scored the most points. In the event of a tie, for the \nfirst time at the 2004 Olympic Games, the “Golden Score” \nrule was used. If there is no winner after the five-minute \nperiod has ended, the referee announces the beginning of \n“Golden Score”. This will extend the match for an extra five-\nminute period and the contestant who scores the first point \nis declared the winner of the match.\nJudo penalties\nTwo types of penalties may be awarded. One is shido and \nanother is hansoku. After two shido are given, the third \nshido becomes hansoku-make and the victory is given to the \nopponent. This is an indirect hansoku-make and does not \nresult in expulsion from the tournament. \nWrestling\nConsidered as one of the most ancient and oldest sport in the \nworld, wrestling has also been equally popular in India. It is \na form of combat sport involving grappling type techniques \nsuch as clinch, fighting, throws, take downs, joint locks \nand other grappling holds. A wrestling bout is a physical \ncompetition, between two (occasionally more) competitors \nor partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior \nposition. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules, \nsuch as, traditional, historic and modern styles. Wrestling \ntechniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as \nwell as military hand-to-hand combat systems.\nActivity 7.1\nWhat is the proficiency \ngiven in India? Make a \nlist.\ne.g.: Yellow belt or Black \nbelt. \nChap-7.indd   124 8/24/2020   11:41:04 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs II\n125\nFig. 7.6: Bout in wrestling\nHistory\nWrestling has been a part of human society since ancient \ntimes. In India also it received regular patronage from the \nEmperors and Kings. Wrestling in India then was popularly \nknown as Malla Yuddha. In famous Indian epic, Mahabharata, \nBhima was considered to be a great wrestler of that time \nand some of the other great wrestlers included Jarasandha, \nDuryodhana, and Karna. Another Indian epic, Ramayana \nalso mentions about wrestling and Hanuman is described \nas one of the great wrestlers of that time. Wrestling in India \ncontinued to increase its popularity during modern days. Even \nduring the British rule, wrestling in India got encouraging \nsupport, as the British rulers included the game into the \nmilitary practice. In fact, India was considered among the \ntop 10 countries in wrestling till the 1960s. India also hosted \nthe World Wrestling Championship at New Delhi in 1967.\nThe term Kushti, which means wrestling, denotes both a \nlocal form of the art as well as a more global combat. Kushti \nis composed of three primary dimensions: dao, pench, and \npaintra (moves, counter-moves, and stance). There may \nbe similarities between the daos known as multani, dhobi \npat, and kalajangh and the corresponding freestyle moves \nknown as arm drag, front hip throw, and fireman carry. But \nwhat is significantly different about wrestling in India is \nthat wrestlers mostly wrestle in mud pits, engage in bouts \nthat last for half an hour or more. At other times and under \nother circumstances Indian wrestlers follow clearly defined \ninternational guidelines, rules, and regulations.\nDo You Know?\nIn 2008, Sushil Kumar \nbrought 2nd Bronze \nMedal for India at Beijing \nOlympic Games. This feat \nwas repeated at 2012 \nOlympics games by Sushil \nKumar (Silver Medal) and \nYogeshwar Dutt Bronze \nMedal. The first medal was \nwon by K.D. Jadhav in \n1952 at Helsinki Games. \nGeeta Phogat became \nthe first Indian woman \nwrestler to represent \nthe country at 2012 \nLondon Olympic Games.\nChap-7.indd   125 8/24/2020   11:41:05 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n126\nWorldwide wrestling entered a new era with the \nacknowledgement of Female Wrestling as an Olympic \ndiscipline in the Athens Games in 2004. \nMeasurement of the wrestling mat\nTerms Dimensions\nDimensions of the mat 9 meters in a circle\nEmpty space on the border of the mat 1 metre\nHeight of the platform 1.10 metre\nColour of marks on the mat Red of Blue\nThickness of the mat 10 cm\nProtection area 1.2 to 1.5 m width\n1.5 m\n7 m\nCentral\nwrestling\narea\n1 m\n1 m\n12 m\n12 m\nProtection area\nPassivity\nzone\nFig. 7.7: Specifications of wrestling play area\nRules and regulations"

In the term judo, ‘ju’ means \n‘gentle’ and ‘do’ means ‘the way or path’.  \nJudo was developed in Japan in the late 19th \ncentury by using the principles of balance and \nleverage adapted from jujutsu. Its most prominent \nfeature is its competitive element, where the \nobjective is to either throw or putdown one’s \nopponent to the ground, immobilise or otherwise \nsubdue one’s opponent with a grappling maneuver, \nor force an opponent to submit by joint locking or \nby executing a stranglehold or choke. Strikes and \nthrusts by hands and feet as well as self-defense \nare a part of judo. Many are trained in Judo either \nfor participation in competition or self-defense.\nHistory\nThe history of judo starts with Japanese jujutsu. It was \ncreated by Professor Jigoro Kano and he believed that the \ntechniques could be practiced as a competitive sport if the \nmore dangerous techniques were omitted. By 1910 Judo was \na recognised sport that could be safely engaged in and in \n1911 it was adopted as a part of Japan’s educational system. \nIn the same year, the Kodokan Judo Instructors’ Training \nDepartment, Kodokan Black Belt Association and Japan \nAthletic Association were formed. World War II saw a different \ndevelopment of Judo. Instead of being used for sport, Judo was \nbeing taught as a combat skill. Those selected for commando \nand special services training often achieved a high standard \nof expertise. When Japan hosted the 1964 Olympics, Judo \nwas given its first opportunity as an event. Of the 16 medals \nawarded for Judo, Japan won three gold medals, and one \nsilver medal. Judo was no longer a Japanese sport but had \ndeveloped to become an international sport. \nThere have been two main developments in Judo over the \nyears. The first was the introduction of weight categories. \nEarlier everyone fought everyone else, with the result that, \nif two players were equally matched in skill, the bigger man \nusually won. Initially there were three categories, and later \nthis was made into five. Inclusion of the sport in the Olympic \nGames in 1964 helped to hasten this important reform.  \nThere are different styles of Judo. With its inclusion in the \nOlympics, there has been a shift towards a contest style \npractice. In clubs where this style is taught, the practice \nbecomes largely a continuous contest. Other schools stress \non skills. They favour repetitive movements to make them \ninstinctive and the development of speed through practice \nwith little resistance. \nFig. 7.5: Player playing Judo\nChap-7.indd   122 8/24/2020   11:41:04 AM\n2024-25",

There \nis one referee who walks around inside the contest area and \nconducts the match. There are two judges who sit diagonally \nacross the mat from one another, each in a corner. The two \njudges assist the referee and indicate when the contestant \ngoes outside of the contest area. The referee is in charge \nof awarding points and accessing penalties and uses hand \ngestures to signal his decision. However, if a judge disagrees \nwith a call, then the three officials take a vote and the decision \nis decided by a majority vote. In addition to the Judge and \nReferees there are also scorekeepers and timers. There is \nusually a scoreboard, which displays points and penalties \nand it can either be electronic or manual. Medical personnel \nare also on hand in the event of injury to a contestant. \nContestants\nThe two contestants, who are known as Judokas, compete for \n5 minutes for men and 4 minutes for women. One contestant \nwears white uniform and the other a blue uniform. \nUniforms\nThe judokas wear loose-fitting judo uniforms called judogi, \nconsisting of pants, a jacket and a belt. Judogi is made up \nof loose-fitting pants, a jacket and a belt that is tied around \nthe waist. The jacket and pants are made of cotton. They \nare either blue or white and they are made so a rival should \nbe able to get a grip on either one of them so as to be able \nto make a judo throw. One judoka will wear white the other \nblue. The belt is three meters long and it is wrapped around \nthe waist twice. The color of the belt signifies the rank the \ncombatant has reached. \nCompetition area\nThe entire competition area in judo is 46 to 53 feet square  \n(14 to 16 meters). This area is made up of foam mats \ncommonly referred to as tatami mats and the individual \nmats are 6.5 feet by 3.281 feet wide (2 meters long, a 1-meter \nwide). Inside the competition area is a contest area, which \nis 8-10 meters square. This contest area (shiaijo) is green in \ncolor, that would be 29.5 feet square (9-meters) and it will \nhave a 3.281 foot (1-meter) red boundary around it. This is \nthe danger zone and it alerts the competitor(s) (judoka) that \nthey are about to go out of bounds. The area outside the \ndanger zone is the safety zone. This zone is three meters wide \nand it is the out-of-bounds area.\nChap-7.indd   123 8/24/2020   11:41:04 AM\n2024-25",

These two \npieces of tape mark the place where the judoka will stand \nwhen they begin and end each bout.\nContest\nA random draw, in the same weight category, is used to \ndetermine which contestants will be fighting each other. In \nthe Olympic Games there are two pools, and each pool has \nits own single-elimination tournament. The two pool winners \nwill compete for the gold medal, with the loser of this contest \nwinning the silver medal. In each pool, the competitors who \nlose to a pool winner are then entered into a repechage round \nwhich is also a single-elimination tournament. The winners of \nthe repechage pools will be the winners of the bronze medals.\nTo win the contest a Judoka must score an Ippon a score \nthat equals 10 points by using successful Judo techniques. \nIf neither of the Judokas is able to score an Ippon or 10 \npoints by the end of the match, the winner will be the Judoka \nwho has scored the most points. In the event of a tie, for the \nfirst time at the 2004 Olympic Games, the “Golden Score” \nrule was used. If there is no winner after the five-minute \nperiod has ended, the referee announces the beginning of \n“Golden Score”. This will extend the match for an extra five-\nminute period and the contestant who scores the first point \nis declared the winner of the match.\nJudo penalties\nTwo types of penalties may be awarded. One is shido and \nanother is hansoku. After two shido are given, the third \nshido becomes hansoku-make and the victory is given to the \nopponent. This is an indirect hansoku-make and does not \nresult in expulsion from the tournament. \nWrestling\nConsidered as one of the most ancient and oldest sport in the \nworld, wrestling has also been equally popular in India. It is \na form of combat sport involving grappling type techniques \nsuch as clinch, fighting, throws, take downs, joint locks \nand other grappling holds. A wrestling bout is a physical \ncompetition, between two (occasionally more) competitors \nor partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior \nposition. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules, \nsuch as, traditional, historic and modern styles. Wrestling \ntechniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as \nwell as military hand-to-hand combat systems.\nActivity 7.1\nWhat is the proficiency \ngiven in India?

In India also it received regular patronage from the \nEmperors and Kings. Wrestling in India then was popularly \nknown as Malla Yuddha. In famous Indian epic, Mahabharata, \nBhima was considered to be a great wrestler of that time \nand some of the other great wrestlers included Jarasandha, \nDuryodhana, and Karna. Another Indian epic, Ramayana \nalso mentions about wrestling and Hanuman is described \nas one of the great wrestlers of that time. Wrestling in India \ncontinued to increase its popularity during modern days. Even \nduring the British rule, wrestling in India got encouraging \nsupport, as the British rulers included the game into the \nmilitary practice. In fact, India was considered among the \ntop 10 countries in wrestling till the 1960s. India also hosted \nthe World Wrestling Championship at New Delhi in 1967.\nThe term Kushti, which means wrestling, denotes both a \nlocal form of the art as well as a more global combat. Kushti \nis composed of three primary dimensions: dao, pench, and \npaintra (moves, counter-moves, and stance). There may \nbe similarities between the daos known as multani, dhobi \npat, and kalajangh and the corresponding freestyle moves \nknown as arm drag, front hip throw, and fireman carry. But \nwhat is significantly different about wrestling in India is \nthat wrestlers mostly wrestle in mud pits, engage in bouts \nthat last for half an hour or more.

It is about 75 km away from Shillong,  \nthe capital of Meghalaya. Most of the houses in this village \nare beautifully decorated with flowers and plants. As per \nthe Census of 2011, the total population of Mawlynnong \nis 414. The main occupation of the villagers is agriculture, \nbut it has also been an age old tradition of ensuring that \nthe surrounding environment is clean. In fact cleanliness is \na collective effort and this practice is ingrained in the people \nsince their childhood. The people voluntarily sweep the roads \nand lanes, water the plants in public areas and clean the \ndrains. A dustbin made out of bamboo is found all along \nthe village. Everyone makes it a point that dirt and waste \nare not thrown anywhere. All the waste from the dustbin is \ncollected and kept in a pit, which the villagers use as manure. \nTrees are planted to restore and maintain nature’s balance. \nMawlynnong’s fame as the cleanest village in Asia, is drawing \na lot of domestic as well as international tourists, as a result of \nwhich tourism is also an important source of employment for \nthe local youths. Besides, there are many interesting sights \nto see such as the famous living root bridge in the nearby \nvillage of Riwai, which is a fascinating example of indigenous \nmethods of conservation and sustainability. Local youths are \navailable as enthusiastic and informative guides.\nFig. 11.1: Mawlynnong Village\nA township in an urban area\nFig. 11.2: A modern township\nChap-11.indd   194 8/24/2020   11:46:07 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nHealtHy Community living\n195\nThis picture is of a modern township derived from an \nadvertisement in a national newspaper.

In addition, we find heaps of garbage scattered \naround the houses.\nActivity 11.2\nYou may conduct a survey in your neighborhood and collect \ninformation on the following —\n • Make a list of some of the basic amenities and community \nresources that are collectively shared by members of your \ncommunity. \n • Make a list of \nsome of the community resources that are not \navailable in your locality. \n • On the basis of your observations and survey, complete the \nfollowing table —\nFeatures appropriate or \nnecessary for healthy \ncommunity living\nFeatures not appropriate \nor necessary for healthy \ncommunity living"

Through these activities, you may have \nobserved that in a community, a group of people live in a particular \nlocal area. Secondly, they share common facilities, which differ from \nplace to place. In some areas, people have access to facilities, such \nas, water supply, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities, health \ncare services, recreational facilities, community centre, schools, \ntransportation, etc., but in some places people do not have access to \neven the most basic amenities. \nA community is said to be healthy when its members \ncontinuously work together to maintain, improve and expand \nthe available natural resources and avoid their wastage.  \nThe healthy community only be develped when its members \nrecognise their roles and responsibilities. They strive to \ninculcate values and attitudes of cooperation, mutual \nrespect, tolerance, kindness, etc. The role of Panchayati Raj, \ncivil societies and other government institutions is also very \nimportant to promote healthy living.\nImportant features of healthy community living\nMaintaining cleanliness of our home and surroundings is \nan essential feature of healthy community living. Healthy \ncommunity is one in which all residents have access to \nquality education, safe and healthy homes, adequate \nemployment, transportation, physical activity and \nnutrition. Living in overcrowded and unhygienic places \nwith excessive noise and pollution, may lead to various \nforms of illnesses, diseases and stress. For instance, lack \nof adequate space, poor ventilation in rooms and toxic \nfumes in the air, increase the risk of air borne diseases. \nAccess to basic amenities such as regular water supply, \nsafe drinking water and sanitation, is important for \nhealthy community living. In the previous classes (Classes \nVII to IX), it has been learnt that open and unattended \ngarbage dumps are a potential breeding place for flies, \ncockroaches, insects and so on. Stagnant water and open \ndrains breed mosquitoes, the carrier of diseases, such as, \nmalaria, dengue and chikungunya. Water borne diseases, \nsuch as, cholera, jaundice, diarrhea and gastroenteritis \nare also resulted due to water pollution.\nAccess to basic amenities also includes other provisions \nsuch as electricity, hospitals, dispensaries, housing facilities, \nroads and transportation, schools, colleges, employment, \nsecurity, recreational facilities and so on. Imagine a situation \nwhen a member in the family falls seriously ill and requires \nurgent treatment. What would happen to this person if there \nare no hospitals in the nearby city, or no transportation \nfacilities to reach there? \nChap-11.indd   196 8/24/2020   11:46:07 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nHealtHy Community living\n197\nTo ensure these basic amenities, the role of the local \ngovernment or panchayats is very important. They are required \nto ensure rules and regulations for safety measures, cleanliness, \nensure equal access of public amenities to all members, \npromote adoption of waste management practices, and help \necological restoration and conservation. However, we cannot \ndepend solely on the government to take the initiative. The \nquality of life in a community also depends on how the members \nof the community work to improve on available resources \nand ensure that the government provides for these facilities. \nYou might have seen this logo before. This is \nthe logo of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan . You \nmust have also seen some of the television \nadvertisements through which the government \nadvertises the importance and necessity of \nstaying clean and keeping our environment \nclean. In this Clean India campaign — known \npopularly as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan , \nthe vision of a Clean and hygienic India, once \nseen by Mahatma Gandhi, can happen only if \nmembers of every community cooperate and \naccept individual and collective responsibility \nof keeping themselves, their homes and their \nsurroundings clean.\nIn order to work collectively, members of a community \nneed to develop values of co-operation, kindness, respect, \ngratitude, joy, peace and selflessness. These attributes are \nimportant in fostering the principles of collective work and \nin nurturing healthy social relationships. The example \nof Mawlynnong village shows that high income alone \nis not the only criterion for healthy living. Cooperative \naction, responsibility and positive values can also help in \nimproving the quality of life, and healthy living conditions \nfor one and all.\nPrevention  of Coronavirus : soCial \nDistanCing anD Dealing  witH stigma\nPrevention through social distancing\nSocial Distancing: Deliberately increasing the physical space \nbetween people to avoid spreading illness and staying at \nleast one meter away from other person decreases chances \nof catching coronavirus (COVID-19).\nSocial distancing: Dos\n • Stay at home unless absolutely necessary.\n • Keep a distance of at least one meter between yourself \nand another person.\nChap-11.indd   197 8/24/2020   11:46:08 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n198\nSocial distancing: Don’ts\n • Do not hold events where people have to gather  \n(even if it is a corner meeting with three or four friends, \nor an evening chat on the chaupal).\n • Do not go to crowded places like markets, shopping, \nmelas, parties.\n • Do not use public transport.\nFig. 11.4: Social distancing dos and don’ts\nCourtesy: https://www.mohfw.gov.in/\nDealing with the stigma\nWhat is stigma?\nIn any epidemic, it is common for individuals to feel stressed \nand worried because they fear —\n • falling ill and dying.\n • approaching health facilities due to fear of becoming \ninfected while in care.\n • losing livelihoods, not being able to work during \nisolation, and of being dismissed from work.\n • being socially excluded or placed in quarantine because \nof being associated with the disease.\n • feeling powerless in protecting loved ones and fear of \nlosing loved ones because of the virus or being separated \nduring quarantine.\n • feelings of helplessness, boredom, loneliness and \ndepression due to being isolated and not working \ntowards caring for a dependent.\nStress is caused due to the above fears and being treated as \nan outcaste or blamed for spreading the disease.\nWhat is the reason behind the stigma?\nThe level of stigma associated with COVID-19 is based on \nthree main factors —\nChap-11.indd   198 8/24/2020   11:46:08 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nHealtHy Community living\n199\n • COVID-19 is a new disease about which many things \nare still being discovered.\n • When something is unknown people are worried which \nleads to fear.\n • Rumours or fake news give wrong information and \nspreads the fear.\nRecognising the stigma\nIt is very important to recognise stigma and handle it. Below \nare four case studies related to these issues. Read these case \nstudies and recognise the stigma.\nCASE 1\nYou are in the grocery shop, there are several people who are \nwearing a mask. You see Babulal, the store owner, going red \nin his face as he tries to suppress a cough.\nCASE 2\nSukhram has come back from Pune where he works as a \ntaxi driver. They stay in a joint family and you have taken \nhis contact history as advised by your supervisor. You come \nto know that Sukhram’s family members have asked him to \nleave the house.\nCASE 3\nBeauty works in Delhi as a house maid. recently she has come \nback and you have been told that beauty’s employers have \nasked her to leave as she had a cold.\nCASE 4\nSurali is a young girl of 11 years. She and her 8-year-old  \nbrother are staying with an aunt as their parents have \nbeen asked to go in for isolation. Surali’s aunt keeps on \ncomplaining to you that the children are a big burden on the  \nfamily’s resources.\nWhat will you feel like if you were Babulal, Rani, Sukhram \nand Beauty?\n • Babulal has simple cough. But he is too scared to \ncough in front of people as he will loose the customers.\n • Sukhram needs family support to help him stay in \nisolation. If everyone takes proper precautions the \ninfection need not spread.\n • Beauty has a seasonal cold but she has been asked to \nleave by her employers.\n • Surali and her brother are two small children who need \nto be supported and this kind of incident can cause \nmental stress even in the future. Child Protection Cell \n(CPC) should be approached for appropriate measures \nfor helping children in difficult situations.\nChap-11.indd   199 8/24/2020   11:46:08 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n200\nFig. 11.5: What does stigma do?\nhttps://www.mohfw.gov.in/\nvalues anD attituDes ConDuCive for \nHealtHy anD CooPerative  living\nHow to develop values and attitudes conducive for healthy and \ncooperative living? These values have to emanate from within \na person, but they can also be developed through various \nother ways. Camping can be seen as one of these ways which \nis extremely appropriate for students, particularly during the \nadolescent period. \nWhat is camping?\nYoungsters might \nhave already attended \na camp or may have \nheard about camping \nactivities f rom friends. \nCamping is an outdoor \nactivity, where familiar \nsurroundings are left to \nspend a night or several \nnights at an outdoor \nsite. The location of \nthese sites varies as \nper the objectives of the \ntrip, time of the year \nand budget available. \nCommon camping sites are: visits to villages or rural areas \nto understand their pattern of living; mountain areas, \nnational parks, lakes, beaches, forests, etc. One can also \nplan camping activities in a nearby place, such as, open \nfields, park, or even in an open space of the school premises.  \nThe basic camping equipment include tents, cooking utensils \nor gadgets, sleeping bags, first aid kits, ropes, insect repellents, \nFig. 11.6: Camping\nChap-11.indd   200 8/24/2020   11:46:09 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nHealtHy Community living\n201\netc. These requirements will vary as per the location of the \ncamping site and objectives of the trip. However, irrespective \nof the location, the essence of all camping activities revolves \naround two main features — \n (i) Bonding with nature\n (ii) Importance of living in a community. \nImportance of camping\nCamping gives students a good break, away from the \nmonotony of the classroom. It gives an opportunity to \nlearn from nature in a joyful, exciting and adventurous \nmanner. Living in the natural environment with students \nfrom different areas, cultures, religions and backgrounds, \nhelp then to learn to work as a team in various activities. \nThese activities differ from adventurous and challenging \nones, to the most basic ones, such as, cooking, cleaning, \ncollecting water, etc. In this process, students learn the \nimportance of self-reliance, teamwork, co-existence, \nimportance of natural resources and organisational skills. \nCamping also offers great opportunities for empowerment \nof the girls.\nFig. 11.7: Trekking  \nFig. 11.8: Mountaineering\n \nFig. 11.9: Rock climbing\nWhile camping, one can engage in adventure sport, \nsuch as, trekking, river rafting, mountaineering, rock \nclimbing, repelling, paragliding, caving. Adventure sport \nhelp to develop courage, self-confidence, leadership \nqualities and enhance concentration powers. This is also \na great form of physical exercise. However, these activities \nshould be conducted only in the presence of qualified and \nprofessional trainers. Joining the National Cadet Corps \n(NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS) or Bharat Scouts \nand Guides will also give you opportunities to take part in \nthese activities.\nChap-11.indd   201 8/24/2020   11:46:14 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n202\nFig. 11.10: Zipline\n \nFig. 11.11: River rafting\nA guided walk through the forest helps to explore \nnature. It can also complement much of the textual data \nin your geography and science textbooks through direct \nexperiences. At the same time, learn to appreciate the beauty \nand simplicity of nature to make all understand how much \ndisconnected from ‘Mother Earth one has become.’ You realise \nthe importance of nature and how we should take care of it. \nMoreover, through interaction with local communities, one \nlearns about edible and medicinal plants, local crafts, first-\naid and various other sustainable forms of living. \nDuring the evenings all may gather around campfires which \ngive a great opportunity for social bonding. Campfires also \nenable to learn about different cultures through story telling, \nsongs, dances, skits and games. On many occasions hidden \ntalents of individuals are brought out during these activities.\nActivity 11.3\nSome of the camping activities have been given in the following table. Write down \nthe qualities which can be developed through the respective activities. You may \nconsult other sources for your answers.\nActivities Qualities developed\nHiking, rock climbing, trekking, rope \nclimbing, river rafting, etc.\nConfidence, leadership qualities, team-\nwork\nNature walk\nCultural activities — patriotic songs, \nlectures on Indian culture and \nheritage through dance, drama, \nsongs, story telling, skits, quizzes, etc.\nCampfire — story telling that emphasize \non moral values based on local folk \ntales, history, games and songs.\nInteraction with local community \nmembers on local crafts, medicines, \nfirst aid, food, etc.\nYoga\nVoluntary services\nChap-11.indd   202 8/24/2020   11:46:15 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nHealtHy Community living\n203\nassessment\n I.

As per \nthe Census of 2011, the total population of Mawlynnong \nis 414. The main occupation of the villagers is agriculture, \nbut it has also been an age old tradition of ensuring that \nthe surrounding environment is clean. In fact cleanliness is \na collective effort and this practice is ingrained in the people \nsince their childhood. The people voluntarily sweep the roads \nand lanes, water the plants in public areas and clean the \ndrains. A dustbin made out of bamboo is found all along \nthe village. Everyone makes it a point that dirt and waste \nare not thrown anywhere. All the waste from the dustbin is \ncollected and kept in a pit, which the villagers use as manure. \nTrees are planted to restore and maintain nature’s balance. \nMawlynnong’s fame as the cleanest village in Asia, is drawing \na lot of domestic as well as international tourists, as a result of \nwhich tourism is also an important source of employment for \nthe local youths.

Through these activities, you may have \nobserved that in a community, a group of people live in a particular \nlocal area. Secondly, they share common facilities, which differ from \nplace to place. In some areas, people have access to facilities, such \nas, water supply, sanitation, garbage disposal facilities, health \ncare services, recreational facilities, community centre, schools, \ntransportation, etc., but in some places people do not have access to \neven the most basic amenities. \nA community is said to be healthy when its members \ncontinuously work together to maintain, improve and expand \nthe available natural resources and avoid their wastage.  \nThe healthy community only be develped when its members \nrecognise their roles and responsibilities. They strive to \ninculcate values and attitudes of cooperation, mutual \nrespect, tolerance, kindness, etc. The role of Panchayati Raj, \ncivil societies and other government institutions is also very \nimportant to promote healthy living.\nImportant features of healthy community living\nMaintaining cleanliness of our home and surroundings is \nan essential feature of healthy community living. Healthy \ncommunity is one in which all residents have access to \nquality education, safe and healthy homes, adequate \nemployment, transportation, physical activity and \nnutrition. Living in overcrowded and unhygienic places \nwith excessive noise and pollution, may lead to various \nforms of illnesses, diseases and stress. For instance, lack \nof adequate space, poor ventilation in rooms and toxic \nfumes in the air, increase the risk of air borne diseases. \nAccess to basic amenities such as regular water supply, \nsafe drinking water and sanitation, is important for \nhealthy community living. In the previous classes (Classes \nVII to IX), it has been learnt that open and unattended \ngarbage dumps are a potential breeding place for flies, \ncockroaches, insects and so on. Stagnant water and open \ndrains breed mosquitoes, the carrier of diseases, such as, \nmalaria, dengue and chikungunya. Water borne diseases, \nsuch as, cholera, jaundice, diarrhea and gastroenteritis \nare also resulted due to water pollution.\nAccess to basic amenities also includes other provisions \nsuch as electricity, hospitals, dispensaries, housing facilities, \nroads and transportation, schools, colleges, employment, \nsecurity, recreational facilities and so on. Imagine a situation \nwhen a member in the family falls seriously ill and requires \nurgent treatment. What would happen to this person if there \nare no hospitals in the nearby city, or no transportation \nfacilities to reach there? \nChap-11.indd   196 8/24/2020   11:46:07 AM\n2024-25",

They are required \nto ensure rules and regulations for safety measures, cleanliness, \nensure equal access of public amenities to all members, \npromote adoption of waste management practices, and help \necological restoration and conservation. However, we cannot \ndepend solely on the government to take the initiative. The \nquality of life in a community also depends on how the members \nof the community work to improve on available resources \nand ensure that the government provides for these facilities. \nYou might have seen this logo before. This is \nthe logo of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan . You \nmust have also seen some of the television \nadvertisements through which the government \nadvertises the importance and necessity of \nstaying clean and keeping our environment \nclean. In this Clean India campaign — known \npopularly as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan , \nthe vision of a Clean and hygienic India, once \nseen by Mahatma Gandhi, can happen only if \nmembers of every community cooperate and \naccept individual and collective responsibility \nof keeping themselves, their homes and their \nsurroundings clean.\nIn order to work collectively, members of a community \nneed to develop values of co-operation, kindness, respect, \ngratitude, joy, peace and selflessness. These attributes are \nimportant in fostering the principles of collective work and \nin nurturing healthy social relationships. The example \nof Mawlynnong village shows that high income alone \nis not the only criterion for healthy living. Cooperative \naction, responsibility and positive values can also help in \nimproving the quality of life, and healthy living conditions \nfor one and all.\nPrevention  of Coronavirus : soCial \nDistanCing anD Dealing  witH stigma\nPrevention through social distancing\nSocial Distancing: Deliberately increasing the physical space \nbetween people to avoid spreading illness and staying at \nleast one meter away from other person decreases chances \nof catching coronavirus (COVID-19).\nSocial distancing: Dos\n • Stay at home unless absolutely necessary.\n • Keep a distance of at least one meter between yourself \nand another person.\nChap-11.indd   197 8/24/2020   11:46:08 AM\n2024-25",

It gives an opportunity to \nlearn from nature in a joyful, exciting and adventurous \nmanner. Living in the natural environment with students \nfrom different areas, cultures, religions and backgrounds, \nhelp then to learn to work as a team in various activities. \nThese activities differ from adventurous and challenging \nones, to the most basic ones, such as, cooking, cleaning, \ncollecting water, etc. In this process, students learn the \nimportance of self-reliance, teamwork, co-existence, \nimportance of natural resources and organisational skills. \nCamping also offers great opportunities for empowerment \nof the girls.\nFig. 11.7: Trekking  \nFig. 11.8: Mountaineering\n \nFig. 11.9: Rock climbing\nWhile camping, one can engage in adventure sport, \nsuch as, trekking, river rafting, mountaineering, rock \nclimbing, repelling, paragliding, caving. Adventure sport \nhelp to develop courage, self-confidence, leadership \nqualities and enhance concentration powers. This is also \na great form of physical exercise. However, these activities \nshould be conducted only in the presence of qualified and \nprofessional trainers.

Each attempt is measured to determine who \nachieved the longest distance or maximum height.\n • Horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) must be \ninitiated from behind a line. In the case of throws, that \nline is an arc or inside a circle. Crossing the line while \ninitiating the attempt will invalidate the attempt. It will \nbe considered as a foul.\nChap-4.indd   47 8/24/2020   11:37:39 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n48\n • All landings must occur inside the area called safe. \nFor the jumps, it is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a \ndefined sector.\n • A throw landing on the line, on the edge of sector, is  \na foul. \n • Assuming a proper attempt, officials will then measure \nthe distance from the closest landing point back to the \nline. \n • Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that \nmeasurement is taken (again) using a steel tape and \nobserved by at least three officials (plus usually the \nmeet referee). \n • The leading 8 competitors in jumps (Long Jump and \nTriple Jump only) and throws will get three more \nattempts in addition to the 3 attempts they already \nhave taken.  \n • In vertical jumps (High Jump and Pole Vault), set the \nbar at a particular height.\n • The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it \noff the stands that are holding the bar (flat).\n • Three failures in a row will end the competitor’s \nparticipation in the event. \n • The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt.\n • A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a \njump. However, that would not improve their position \nin the standings. \n • After all competitors have cleared, passed or failed their \nattempts at a height, the bar height will be raised.\n • The height of the bar raised is predetermined before the \ncompetition. Though when one competitor remains, \nthat competitor may choose their own selected height \nfor the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each \nattempt by each competitor. \n • After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one \nwho jumps the highest height is the winner. The bar \ndoes not shift to a lower height except to break a tie \nfor first place or a qualifying position. If those critical \npositions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, \nall tied competitors will take a fourth jump at the last \nheight. \n • If they still miss, the bar will go down one increment \nwhere they will again jump. This process will continue \nuntil the tie is broken.\nActivity 4.12\nThe details aim at making \nus understand  that the \nathletes participate in \ndifferent types of jumping \nand throwing events. \nIdentify —\nHorizontal Jump (1)\n  (2)\nVertical Jump (1)\n  (2)\nThrows  (1)\n  (2)\n  (3)\nChap-4.indd   48 8/24/2020   11:37:39 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nIndIvIdual Games and sports I\n49\nActivity 4.13\nGiven below the names of various events in one column.

It includes Ahara (Food), Vihara (Relaxation), \nAchara (Conduct), Vichara (Thinking), Vyavahara (Behaviour).\nTheories of training are also included in this subject area. \nThese are principles  and characteristics of sports training, \nmethods of sports training, training load, warming up, \ncooling down, aerobic and anaerobic activities, calisthenics \nand rhythmic exercises, specific training program for \ndevelopment of various motor qualities, techniques, tactics \nand talent identification. It is also important to understand \nthe difference between play, games and sports.\nPlay, GamEs and sPort\nThough these terms are used interchangeably, these are \nactually different. \nPlay\nPlay is spontaneous. It is usually a creative activity but has \nits own limitation and space. One plays voluntarily for fun \nand pleasure. Play, however, is a broad area which includes \nboth games and sports. The distinctive features of play are \nthat they are free, separate, uncertain, governed by self rules \nand creative.\nGames\nGenerally the word games and sports are used together.  \nA game is an activity involving more players, defined by a goal \nthat the players tries to reach, and some set rules to play. \nBy masses, games are played primarily for entertainment \nor enjoyment. The difference of purpose differentiates sport \nfrom game, combined with the notion of individual or team \nskill. Games are also played on the basis of a set of rules.  \nA game is defined as a goal that the players try to achieve. A \nperson who participates in a game is known as a player. \nSport\nA sport is a physical activity carried out under an agreed set \nof rules, for competition or self-enjoyment or a combination \nof these.  Sport are the kind of activities in which similar \nkind of body movement is repeated over a long time. For \nexample, swimming and running and almost all the track \nand field events come under sport. Sport involves an activity \nor activities where the mental capabilities of the sportsperson \nare judged. In a sport, it is the sportsperson or the individual \nwho determines the outcome. A person participating in a \nsport is called an athlete or a sportsperson. \nActivity 1.3\nThe teacher divides \nstudents into small groups \nof 10 and plans an aerobic \ndance or drama. Keeping \nin view the skill, creativity, \nand music, these may \neven be in the form of a \ncompetition.\nChap-1.indd   5 8/28/2020   4:45:57 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n6\nrElationshi P of hEalth and Physical  \nEducation  With othEr disciPlinEs of \nKnoWlEdGE\nHealth and Physical Education (HPE) classes provide space \nfor exploring new ideas related to personal and community \nhealth. These ideas might then be used by students in various \nother fields of learning, such as, arts, science, civics and \ncitizenship, communication, design, creativity and technology \nand languages (english, hindi and other regional languages), \nhumanities (e.g. history, geography, economics, etc.), \ninformation and communication technology and psychology.\nArt\nHealth and physical education teachers can incorporate \nactivities related to performing arts, drawing, painting, \ndance, drama, media, music and visual communication into \ntheir programs. These involve both fine motor skills and \nwhole body movement including rhythmic movement. As \nbody movements are part of both arts practice and health \nand physical education, these promote health knowledge, \nunderstanding of the body and lead to physical fitness and \nenhancing of creative skills at the same time. \nScience\nThe human body is a common concern of both science and \nhealth and physical education. In science, students study the \nhuman body from the cellular level to the systems level, with \na focus on anatomy and physiology. In health and physical \neducation learning is focused on the requirements for good \nhealth and the promotion of a healthy body. Students gain \nan understanding of the role of physical and yogic activities \nin ensuring good health and can link the functioning of the \nmusculo-skeletal, digestive, endocrine and nervous systems \nstudied in science, for the promotion of the physical, social, \nmental and emotional health of individuals within a society. \nStudents consider it their personal responsibilities to discuss \nand adopt health issues, both in relation to their own safety \nand well-being, as well as to the safety and well-being of \nothers. It also contributes in the designing of training for \nmovements of organs to achieve optimal performance in the \narea of play, sports and games.\nSocial science\nSocial sciences promote the idea that citizens require \nknowledge and understanding of civic institutions and the \nskills and willingness to actively participate in functioning \nof the society. Similarly, in health and physical education, \nChap-1.indd   6 8/28/2020   4:45:57 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nPhysical Education: RElationshiP with othER subjEcts\n7\nstudents are encouraged to become active and responsible \nmembers of their community. Key concepts within health \nand physical education classes include understanding of \nthe importance of personal identity within a community, \nwhat makes a community and how to engage with different \nmembers and agencies within a community. Participation in \nphysical activity and sports also reflect values, rules, rights \nand responsibilities indicative of a democratic society. \nCommunication\nCommunication involves developing knowledge, skills and \nbehaviors that empower students to respond to, make meaning \nof, and deconstruct a range of communication forms. Effective \ncommunication is a key skill in health and physical education. \nIt is essential that students develop the ability to listen, view \nand respond with respect to the content and context in which \ncommunication happens. Learning in the health and physical \neducation domain involves developing familiarity with forms, \nlanguage and conventions used in different forms of public, \npersonal and interpersonal communication.\nDesign, Creativity and Technology\nDesign, Creativity and Technology (DCT) help in developing \nsport goods, sportwear, sport software programme, etc. \nThese are associated with knowledge and promotion.  In \nthis area students learn about the characteristic and \nproperties of how all these aspects differ from each other.  \nThese investigations assist students to make decisions about \nappropriate solution. Students analyse and evaluate factors, \nsuch as, social, cultural and economic factors that influence \ndesign, creativity and technology.\nLanguage(s)\nLanguages help students to develop critical approaches to \nthe ideas and thoughts collated to read, view, write, compare, \nresearch and talk about texts. Health and Physical Education \nteachers can use examples related to health and wellbeing \nto encourage students to reflect on their lifestyles and \nanalyse ways by which the media influences their attitude \ntowards health. For example, Health and Physical Education \nemphasises on the importance of physical fitness, self-esteem \nand body image in the maintenance of good health.\nEconomics\nEconomics is the study of how society allocates scarce \nresources to satisfy the wants and needs of its members. \nWithin the health and physical education (HPE) context, \nconsumer health assists students to become more \ninformed consumers of health products and services.  \nActivity 1.4\n • Identify and analyse \nhealth needs and \nservices available in \nthe community.\n • Investigate the cost of \nspecific behaviours, \nillness or disease in \nthe community, such \nas, the economic \nimpact of obesity and \ninactivity on society.\n • Explore the influence \nof government \nspending on health \noutcomes for \nindividuals and the \ncommunity.\n • Identify various \nlocations from the map \nand interpret maps \nfor outdoor adventure \nactivities.\n • Investigate the impact \nof development and \nglobalisation on \npoverty, the links \nbetween food, hunger \nand technology,  \nidentifying and locating \nfacilities and services \nthat contribute to the \nhealth and safety of \ncommunities on a local \nand national level.\nChap-1.indd   7 8/28/2020   4:45:57 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n8\nThe cost of disease emerging from unhealthy lifestyle is \nalso studied to determine the burden of disease on families \nand community.\nGeography\nStudents develop skills in reading and interpreting maps of \ndifferent kinds and at different scales. The same knowledge and \nskills are reinforced in physical education during orientation \non outdoor education activities (Trekking, Mountaineering, \netc). The investigation of local and global health issues involves \ncollecting information from maps, satellite images, statistical \ndata and information and communication technology based \nresources. These help students to understand themselves \nand their world, to apply their understanding in their present \nlives as well as make evidence based decisions that lead to \nthe kind of future they desire.\nHistory\nThe study of History reflects multiple influences and \nconnections to an array of other countries, cultures and \ntimes. The concepts of time, chronology and changes are \ncommon to both History and Health and Physical Education. \nWhile History focuses on identity from a cultural or national \nperspective, Health and Physical Education focuses on the \nrange of factors that shape personal identity.\nLike skill correction analysis programme, use of cameras \nand videos in game, use of wind gauge, Iso kinetic machines, \nconstruction and marking of play field.\nInformation and Communications Technology (ICT)\nICT can be used to access, process, manage and present \ninformation and events. It constructs new understanding and \ncommunicate with others. It is an integral part of different \ntraining measurement and evaluation and offcourse coaching \nand officiating very helpful in conducting tournament.\nMathematics\nIn Health a nd Physical Education, Mathematics provides \ntools and procedures which can be used to model situations \nand solve problems in areas, such as, scoring different \nsporting events involving time, distance, weight and number \nas variables, calculating percentage improvement in results \nfrom data collected through fitness testing or performance in \nphysical activities.\nActivity 1.5\n • Create a report and \nmay be a presentation \nabout a game of your \nchoice.\n • Capture still and \nmoving images of \nsporting activities \norganised in your \nschool and edit \nor annotate them \nto explain skill \ndevelopment or tactics.\n • Identify, collect and \nevaluate data from \nonline sources such \nas, blogs, websites \nand forums to inform \nabout myths related to \nPhysical Education. \nChap-1.indd   8 8/28/2020   4:45:57 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nPhysical Education: RElationshiP with othER subjEcts\n9\nLanguage other than English (LOTE)\nThere are a number of martial arts developed by different \nsocieties. The text of these martial arts is discussed in the \nlocal languages. For folk dances the accompanying songs are \nin regional languages and music has its own characteristic \ntone and rhythm.\nThe concepts of movement, dance, physical activity and sport, \nvary culturally. These are associated with their own specific \nlanguages, vocabularies and discourses. Different societies have \ndifferent attitudes, values and beliefs about physical activities \nwhich are expressed in their regional languages.\nmyths and misconc EPtions about Physical  \nEducation\nMyths are surrounded in regard to relationship of physical \neducation with academic success. One of the most discussed \nmyths in the society is that participation in sport and games \nreduces academic performance of individual.\nMyths\nParticipation in sport kills the time of study. Contrary to the \nwidely held assumption that sport and other activities cut upon \nthe time for serious school study, research evidence has shown \nthat students tend to do better in school when they participate \nin physical activities. There is a positive correlation between \nperformance in sport and the level of academic achievement. \nPhysical education including sport is an integral part of the \nsocial and cultural infrastructure of a nation. It really can \nmake a difference in the broader educational process and in \nchanging and enhancing the quality of life. Vigorous physical \nexercise stimulates circulation, helps prevent skin eruptions \nand increases fluid intake. These exercises also promote \nself-worth and mental health, and support an individual for \nhealing an injury. Sport also enhances physical performance \nand induce positive physiological adaptation. When children \nexercise, their fitness needs are met, and build up energy \nto learn and achieve. Given the growing number of children \nwith obesity, watching TV, continuously being involved in \ncomputer games and other unwanted activities, frequency \nof the children getting involved in physical achievement \nand academic performance, has taken a back seat. Physical \nexercise enhances the function in joints, increases the sense \nof physical well being and promotes a sense of feeling good. It \nalso increases physical working capacity by increasing cardio-\nrespiratory fitness and increased strength and endurance \nand decreases risk of serious disease that could lead to early \ndisability and death.\nActivity 1.6\n • Identify, collect and \nevaluate data from \nonline sources, such \nas, blogs, websites \nand forums to inform \nabout myths related to \nPhysical Education.\nChap-1.indd   9 8/28/2020   4:45:57 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n10\n I.

It includes Ahara (Food), Vihara (Relaxation), \nAchara (Conduct), Vichara (Thinking), Vyavahara (Behaviour).\nTheories of training are also included in this subject area. \nThese are principles  and characteristics of sports training, \nmethods of sports training, training load, warming up, \ncooling down, aerobic and anaerobic activities, calisthenics \nand rhythmic exercises, specific training program for \ndevelopment of various motor qualities, techniques, tactics \nand talent identification. It is also important to understand \nthe difference between play, games and sports.\nPlay, GamEs and sPort\nThough these terms are used interchangeably, these are \nactually different. \nPlay\nPlay is spontaneous. It is usually a creative activity but has \nits own limitation and space. One plays voluntarily for fun \nand pleasure. Play, however, is a broad area which includes \nboth games and sports. The distinctive features of play are \nthat they are free, separate, uncertain, governed by self rules \nand creative.\nGames\nGenerally the word games and sports are used together.  \nA game is an activity involving more players, defined by a goal \nthat the players tries to reach, and some set rules to play. \nBy masses, games are played primarily for entertainment \nor enjoyment. The difference of purpose differentiates sport \nfrom game, combined with the notion of individual or team \nskill. Games are also played on the basis of a set of rules.  \nA game is defined as a goal that the players try to achieve. A \nperson who participates in a game is known as a player. \nSport\nA sport is a physical activity carried out under an agreed set \nof rules, for competition or self-enjoyment or a combination \nof these.  Sport are the kind of activities in which similar \nkind of body movement is repeated over a long time. For \nexample, swimming and running and almost all the track \nand field events come under sport. Sport involves an activity \nor activities where the mental capabilities of the sportsperson \nare judged. In a sport, it is the sportsperson or the individual \nwho determines the outcome. A person participating in a \nsport is called an athlete or a sportsperson. \nActivity 1.3\nThe teacher divides \nstudents into small groups \nof 10 and plans an aerobic \ndance or drama. Keeping \nin view the skill, creativity, \nand music, these may \neven be in the form of a \ncompetition.\nChap-1.indd   5 8/28/2020   4:45:57 PM\n2024-25",

These ideas might then be used by students in various \nother fields of learning, such as, arts, science, civics and \ncitizenship, communication, design, creativity and technology \nand languages (english, hindi and other regional languages), \nhumanities (e.g. history, geography, economics, etc.), \ninformation and communication technology and psychology.\nArt\nHealth and physical education teachers can incorporate \nactivities related to performing arts, drawing, painting, \ndance, drama, media, music and visual communication into \ntheir programs. These involve both fine motor skills and \nwhole body movement including rhythmic movement. As \nbody movements are part of both arts practice and health \nand physical education, these promote health knowledge, \nunderstanding of the body and lead to physical fitness and \nenhancing of creative skills at the same time. \nScience\nThe human body is a common concern of both science and \nhealth and physical education. In science, students study the \nhuman body from the cellular level to the systems level, with \na focus on anatomy and physiology. In health and physical \neducation learning is focused on the requirements for good \nhealth and the promotion of a healthy body. Students gain \nan understanding of the role of physical and yogic activities \nin ensuring good health and can link the functioning of the \nmusculo-skeletal, digestive, endocrine and nervous systems \nstudied in science, for the promotion of the physical, social, \nmental and emotional health of individuals within a society. \nStudents consider it their personal responsibilities to discuss \nand adopt health issues, both in relation to their own safety \nand well-being, as well as to the safety and well-being of \nothers. It also contributes in the designing of training for \nmovements of organs to achieve optimal performance in the \narea of play, sports and games.\nSocial science\nSocial sciences promote the idea that citizens require \nknowledge and understanding of civic institutions and the \nskills and willingness to actively participate in functioning \nof the society.

Key concepts within health \nand physical education classes include understanding of \nthe importance of personal identity within a community, \nwhat makes a community and how to engage with different \nmembers and agencies within a community. Participation in \nphysical activity and sports also reflect values, rules, rights \nand responsibilities indicative of a democratic society. \nCommunication\nCommunication involves developing knowledge, skills and \nbehaviors that empower students to respond to, make meaning \nof, and deconstruct a range of communication forms. Effective \ncommunication is a key skill in health and physical education. \nIt is essential that students develop the ability to listen, view \nand respond with respect to the content and context in which \ncommunication happens. Learning in the health and physical \neducation domain involves developing familiarity with forms, \nlanguage and conventions used in different forms of public, \npersonal and interpersonal communication.\nDesign, Creativity and Technology\nDesign, Creativity and Technology (DCT) help in developing \nsport goods, sportwear, sport software programme, etc. \nThese are associated with knowledge and promotion.  In \nthis area students learn about the characteristic and \nproperties of how all these aspects differ from each other.  \nThese investigations assist students to make decisions about \nappropriate solution. Students analyse and evaluate factors, \nsuch as, social, cultural and economic factors that influence \ndesign, creativity and technology.\nLanguage(s)\nLanguages help students to develop critical approaches to \nthe ideas and thoughts collated to read, view, write, compare, \nresearch and talk about texts. Health and Physical Education \nteachers can use examples related to health and wellbeing \nto encourage students to reflect on their lifestyles and \nanalyse ways by which the media influences their attitude \ntowards health. For example, Health and Physical Education \nemphasises on the importance of physical fitness, self-esteem \nand body image in the maintenance of good health.\nEconomics\nEconomics is the study of how society allocates scarce \nresources to satisfy the wants and needs of its members. \nWithin the health and physical education (HPE) context, \nconsumer health assists students to become more \ninformed consumers of health products and services.  \nActivity 1.4\n • Identify and analyse \nhealth needs and \nservices available in \nthe community.\n • Investigate the cost of \nspecific behaviours, \nillness or disease in \nthe community, such \nas, the economic \nimpact of obesity and \ninactivity on society.\n • Explore the influence \nof government \nspending on health \noutcomes for \nindividuals and the \ncommunity.\n • Identify various \nlocations from the map \nand interpret maps \nfor outdoor adventure \nactivities.\n • Investigate the impact \nof development and \nglobalisation on \npoverty, the links \nbetween food, hunger \nand technology,  \nidentifying and locating \nfacilities and services \nthat contribute to the \nhealth and safety of \ncommunities on a local \nand national level.\nChap-1.indd   7 8/28/2020   4:45:57 PM\n2024-25",

The same knowledge and \nskills are reinforced in physical education during orientation \non outdoor education activities (Trekking, Mountaineering, \netc). The investigation of local and global health issues involves \ncollecting information from maps, satellite images, statistical \ndata and information and communication technology based \nresources. These help students to understand themselves \nand their world, to apply their understanding in their present \nlives as well as make evidence based decisions that lead to \nthe kind of future they desire.\nHistory\nThe study of History reflects multiple influences and \nconnections to an array of other countries, cultures and \ntimes. The concepts of time, chronology and changes are \ncommon to both History and Health and Physical Education. \nWhile History focuses on identity from a cultural or national \nperspective, Health and Physical Education focuses on the \nrange of factors that shape personal identity.\nLike skill correction analysis programme, use of cameras \nand videos in game, use of wind gauge, Iso kinetic machines, \nconstruction and marking of play field.\nInformation and Communications Technology (ICT)\nICT can be used to access, process, manage and present \ninformation and events.

Contrary to the \nwidely held assumption that sport and other activities cut upon \nthe time for serious school study, research evidence has shown \nthat students tend to do better in school when they participate \nin physical activities.

Vigorous physical \nexercise stimulates circulation, helps prevent skin eruptions \nand increases fluid intake. These exercises also promote \nself-worth and mental health, and support an individual for \nhealing an injury. Sport also enhances physical performance \nand induce positive physiological adaptation. When children \nexercise, their fitness needs are met, and build up energy \nto learn and achieve. Given the growing number of children \nwith obesity, watching TV, continuously being involved in \ncomputer games and other unwanted activities, frequency \nof the children getting involved in physical achievement \nand academic performance, has taken a back seat. Physical \nexercise enhances the function in joints, increases the sense \nof physical well being and promotes a sense of feeling good. It \nalso increases physical working capacity by increasing cardio-\nrespiratory fitness and increased strength and endurance \nand decreases risk of serious disease that could lead to early \ndisability and death.\nActivity 1.6\n • Identify, collect and \nevaluate data from \nonline sources, such \nas, blogs, websites \nand forums to inform \nabout myths related to \nPhysical Education.\nChap-1.indd   9 8/28/2020   4:45:57 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n10\n I.

Many substances have been used as medicines since \nages in one or the other form, but modern times have seen a \ntremendous growth in terms of types and usage of medicines.  \nWhile medicines are used to treat diseases and can be life \nsaving, they can harm the body if not used correctly.\nMedicines are used in the form of injections, tablets, \nsyrups, creams, lotions, solutions, drops, powder, sprays \nand straps.\nMedicines affect us in many ways.  Some of the common \nways are —\n • Analgesics — reducing pain and in fever.\n • Antibodies — killing or weakening microbes and infections.\n • Lotions — in burns and allergies, for soothing effect.\n • Supplements — correcting deficiencies due to vitamins, \nnutrients.\n • Antipsychotic drugs — modifying the body’s response, \npsychological disorders.\n • Vaccines and inoculations and immunisation — \nProtecting and preventing.\n • Hormones — supporting physiological functions.\n • Herbal medicines — plants herbs\nAlthough  medicines assist us to lead a healthy life free \nof diseases, there are also certain undesirable effects  due to \nDo You Know?\n30 compressions followed \nby two breaths counts \nconsists of one cycle of \nCPR.\nFig. 10.3: Performing mouth to \nmouth breathing\nFig. 10.4: Recovery position\nActivity 10.4\nLet us learn about \ncommon medicines, \ntheir effects and what \nhappens if they are used \nincorrectly.\nChap-10.indd   186 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nSafety MeaSureS for HealtHy living\n187\nmechanism of action of the medicine or if taken more than \nthe recommended dose. Thus, it is important to take the \nmedicines only under medical supervision.\nPrecautions while taking medicines\nMedicines need to be used in the required dose so that they \nshould not only have the desired effect but also prevent \nundesired side effects. Some of the precautions while taking \nmedicines are —\n • Take medicines only if prescribed by a doctor. Self \nmedication may be dangerous.\n • Take the recommended dose of the medicine and at \nthe prescribed interval. Only then there will be desired \neffects. One should never adjust the dose oneself.\n • Do not minimise or exceed the dose and frequency of \ntaking the medicine. This can cause undesirable effects\n • Adult dose of medicines should not be given to children. \nThere are special forms and doses of medicines for \nchildren. Keep all medicines out of reach of children. \nIngestion by them may cause emergency.\n • Store the medicines away from extreme temperature \nand sunlight.\n • Always check the expiry date of medicines before \nconsumption.\n • Use a  full cup of water and drink standing upright \nwhile swallowing a tablet.\n • Do not take any medicine on an empty stomach unless \nprescribed by the doctor.\n • Keep a list of medicines one is allergic to. Always tell \nthe doctor about such medicine(s). \n • Always visit the doctor if one experiences any unusual \nsymptom while taking the prescribed medicines.\n • It is important that the medicine should be taken \nregularly for the entire period and duration as prescribed \nby the doctor. Otherwise the disease due to infections \ncan return. \nSubStance (drug) abuSe \nIn an effort to establish their identity and desire for \nexperimentation, adolescents often try out new things. \nAlso they are more amenable to external influences, such  \nas, the media and peers. This makes them more vulnerable \nto substance misuse, especially when they do not have \ncorrect and scientific information. They also lack life skills \nto deal with the wide ranging negative outcomes of extreme \ndependency on a substance and thereby, getting addicted  \nto it.\nDo You Know?\nOur physiological \nfunctions are supported \nby hormones.\nActivity 10.5\nWhat is the use of \nvitamins in our body?\nChap-10.indd   187 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n188\nWhat is substance abuse?\nAs you have learnt, drugs affect the body by changing \nthe mental and physical status of a person. Some other \nsubstances also work in the same way and are not necessarily \ndrugs.  The non-medical use of a substance including drugs, \nthat changes an individual’s mental and physical status and \naffect the health adversely, is known as substance abuse. \nOnce a person starts using a substance, his mental state \nis altered and the person cannot get out of this habit. The \nextreme dependency on the substance compels them to  \nincrease the intake every day. This is called addiction. \nSubstance misuse is widespread today including \nadolescents across the world.  Socially acceptable drugs \nlike tobacco and alcohol abuse not only ruins the life of the \nindividual but can also influence them to associated with \ncrime and violence.\nCommonly abused substances \nThere are substances that can be abused for their mood-\naltering effects such as inhalants and solvents. On the other \nhand, there are drugs that can be abused that have no mood-\naltering or intoxication properties, such as, anabolic steroids. \nThey are abused by the adolescents and youth during body \nbuilding, to look more muscular.\nCommonly abused substances are tobacco, alcohol, \nmarijuana (ganja), opium, cannabis, solvents (petrol, glue, \ncorrection ink) and aerosols inhalants, cough syrup, caffeine, \ncocaine and ecstasy.  There are other substances like gutka \nand paan (betel). \nThese substances can be ingested, inhaled, drunk, \nchewed or injected by a syringe in the blood.  Some of these \nsubstances make one addicted, even if taken once.\nReasons for substance abuse in young people \nYoung people are more vulnerable to substance abuse due to \nthe following reasons —\n • During the process of growing up, poor self-esteem, low \nachievement at school, performance pressures, etc,. \nare some of the factors that promote substance abuse \nin adolescence.  Resorting to substance use as a means \nof ‘growing up’ or fun also makes the adolescents more \nvulnerable to substance abuse.\n • Pressure from peers or friends to try an addictive \nsubstance, the urge to gain popularity among friends, \nand desire to experiment and curiosity to try out new \nthings also make young people particularly vulnerable \nto substance abuse.\nChap-10.indd   188 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nSafety MeaSureS for HealtHy living\n189\n • Previous experience of taking substance.\n • Family history of substance misuse.\n • Lack of support from family, friends and school. \n • Lack of knowledge about the effects and dangers of \nconsuming addictive substances.\n • Glamorising substance misuse  by media misleads \nyoung people. \n • Easy availability of substances and drugs are the main \nreasons for substance misuse in young people.\n • Social approval of substance abuse like tobacco, paan, \nbeetel nut, gutka chewing or taking wine in parties \nencourages young people to initiate abuse of these \nsubstances.\nCASE 1\nSohan has performed well in Class IX annual exams. Now, he \nis worried whether he will be able to keep up his performance \nand score good grades in Class X. His parents always tell him \nhow they expect to see him at the top of his class.  Afraid \nof disappointing them, Sohan does not share his concerns \nwith his parents. He feels that some of his friends may be \ngoing through the same phase and discusses his problem with \nthem. His friends suggest that smoking may reduce his stress \nand help him to relax. Sohan wants to feel better and decides \nto follow his friends’ advice. He starts smoking a cigarette or \ntwo everyday.  Without realising, over a period of six months \nhe was smoking 6-10 cigarettes a day. Smoking has become a \nhabit with him, and in future, it was the cause of his ill health.\nPoints for Discussion\n a) What do you think is responsible for Sohan’s habit of \nsmoking and why?\n b) Do you think smoking helped reduce Sohan’s stress? \nWhy?\n c) What else could Sohan have done to reduce his stress \neffectively? \n d) What role could Sohan’s parents have played to prevent \nhim from smoking? \nConsequences of substance abuse\nSubstance misuse leads to a number of short-term and long-\nterm effects that are detrimental to health. \nShort-term effects: These are effects that appear only \na few minutes after the intake of substance. The user feels \na false sense of well-being and a pleasant drowsiness.  \nSome of the short-term effects are distorted vision, hearing \nand coordination, impaired judgment, bad breath and \nhangovers.\nChap-10.indd   189 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n190\nLong-term effects: Substances having a long-term \nimpact lead to serious damage due to constant and excessive \nuse. These effects show up over a course of time and are \nusually caused by progressive damage to different body \norgans. Some of the health consequences include irregular \neating habits, sleep disorders, poor hygiene resulting in \npoor health and low immunity. This predisposes substance \nabuser to diseases and infections. \nSubstance abuse in itself is not a cause of HIV/AIDS or \nSTDs but under the influence of drugs, people may engage \nin risk-behaviours that make them more susceptible to \nthese infections. Injectable drug users, however, are more \nprone to HIV in conditions where the users do not sterilise \nneedles and share needles to inject the drug. \nSubstance users may even die suddenly from a so-called \noverdose, when one consumes more than what the body \ncan tolerate. Death may also occur from long-term damage \nto the organs of the body.\nThese substances are especially harmful if consumed \nduring pregnancy. These substances reach the foetus \nthrough blood and harm it by crippling its growth and \ndevelopment or death. \nSubstance abuse influences not only the individual \nand family but also the community. The persons who get \naddicted often lose interest in other activities be it school, \njob or any other responsibility. They are not able to take \ncare of their responsibilities and may become a liability \nfor their families and finally the society. Furthermore, it is \nexpensive to buy substances or drugs on a regular basis. \nHence, in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced \nto engage in petty severe crimes. \nPrevention of drug abuse\nPaying attention to the following may prevent young people \nfrom misusing substances —\n • Peer pressure can be managed by being aware of \nthe implications of substance abuse and developing \nlife skills. One can not only save oneself from \nadopting risky behaviours under peer pressure but \nalso persuade the peers not to engage in unhealthy \nbehaviours such as substance misuse. Advocacy \nwith the involvement of local community can be quite \nuseful.\n • The different ways of dealing with negative peer \npressure are saying ‘No’ assertively, making an \nexcuse, reversal of pressure, and giving reasons.\n • Young people should also be educated to recognise \nthat a friend is someone who cares, protects and looks \nActivity 10.6\nDiscuss how a substance \nabuser’s life gets affected.\nChap-10.indd   190 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nSafety MeaSureS for HealtHy living\n191\nafter the welfare of their friends rather than force and \ninitiate into unhealthy habits. \n • Young people should be empowered with life skills to \nknow about their body and their life. They should be \ntaking well-informed and responsible decisions.\n • The family and society should provide the support \nsystem for young children in their ‘low’ times.\n • As the attitudes related to smoking, drinking and \nmisuse of other substances are formed during \npre-adolescence and early adolescence, this is an \nimportant age to invest in prevention efforts. The \nfamily, community and educational institutions \nshould empower young people with correct and \nscientific information.\nYoung children should be encouraged to get engaged \nin socially productive activities. For example, one can \nstart a learning centre for the lesser advantaged children \nin the neighbourhood, one can learn Braille and help at \nblind school, and one can create awareness about water \nconservation in the neighbourhood. This will help them to \nchannelise their energy, being away from the menace of \nsubstance abuse and also inculcate social responsibility\nChap-10.indd   191 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n192\naSSeSSMent\n I.

Thus, it is important to take the \nmedicines only under medical supervision.\nPrecautions while taking medicines\nMedicines need to be used in the required dose so that they \nshould not only have the desired effect but also prevent \nundesired side effects. Some of the precautions while taking \nmedicines are —\n • Take medicines only if prescribed by a doctor. Self \nmedication may be dangerous.\n • Take the recommended dose of the medicine and at \nthe prescribed interval. Only then there will be desired \neffects. One should never adjust the dose oneself.\n • Do not minimise or exceed the dose and frequency of \ntaking the medicine. This can cause undesirable effects\n • Adult dose of medicines should not be given to children. \nThere are special forms and doses of medicines for \nchildren. Keep all medicines out of reach of children. \nIngestion by them may cause emergency.\n • Store the medicines away from extreme temperature \nand sunlight.\n • Always check the expiry date of medicines before \nconsumption.\n • Use a  full cup of water and drink standing upright \nwhile swallowing a tablet.\n • Do not take any medicine on an empty stomach unless \nprescribed by the doctor.\n • Keep a list of medicines one is allergic to. Always tell \nthe doctor about such medicine(s). \n • Always visit the doctor if one experiences any unusual \nsymptom while taking the prescribed medicines.\n • It is important that the medicine should be taken \nregularly for the entire period and duration as prescribed \nby the doctor.

Some other \nsubstances also work in the same way and are not necessarily \ndrugs.  The non-medical use of a substance including drugs, \nthat changes an individual’s mental and physical status and \naffect the health adversely, is known as substance abuse. \nOnce a person starts using a substance, his mental state \nis altered and the person cannot get out of this habit. The \nextreme dependency on the substance compels them to  \nincrease the intake every day. This is called addiction. \nSubstance misuse is widespread today including \nadolescents across the world.  Socially acceptable drugs \nlike tobacco and alcohol abuse not only ruins the life of the \nindividual but can also influence them to associated with \ncrime and violence.\nCommonly abused substances \nThere are substances that can be abused for their mood-\naltering effects such as inhalants and solvents. On the other \nhand, there are drugs that can be abused that have no mood-\naltering or intoxication properties, such as, anabolic steroids. \nThey are abused by the adolescents and youth during body \nbuilding, to look more muscular.\nCommonly abused substances are tobacco, alcohol, \nmarijuana (ganja), opium, cannabis, solvents (petrol, glue, \ncorrection ink) and aerosols inhalants, cough syrup, caffeine, \ncocaine and ecstasy.  There are other substances like gutka \nand paan (betel). \nThese substances can be ingested, inhaled, drunk, \nchewed or injected by a syringe in the blood.  Some of these \nsubstances make one addicted, even if taken once.\nReasons for substance abuse in young people \nYoung people are more vulnerable to substance abuse due to \nthe following reasons —\n • During the process of growing up, poor self-esteem, low \nachievement at school, performance pressures, etc,. \nare some of the factors that promote substance abuse \nin adolescence.  Resorting to substance use as a means \nof ‘growing up’ or fun also makes the adolescents more \nvulnerable to substance abuse.\n • Pressure from peers or friends to try an addictive \nsubstance, the urge to gain popularity among friends, \nand desire to experiment and curiosity to try out new \nthings also make young people particularly vulnerable \nto substance abuse.\nChap-10.indd   188 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\n2024-25",

Now, he \nis worried whether he will be able to keep up his performance \nand score good grades in Class X. His parents always tell him \nhow they expect to see him at the top of his class.  Afraid \nof disappointing them, Sohan does not share his concerns \nwith his parents. He feels that some of his friends may be \ngoing through the same phase and discusses his problem with \nthem. His friends suggest that smoking may reduce his stress \nand help him to relax. Sohan wants to feel better and decides \nto follow his friends’ advice. He starts smoking a cigarette or \ntwo everyday.  Without realising, over a period of six months \nhe was smoking 6-10 cigarettes a day. Smoking has become a \nhabit with him, and in future, it was the cause of his ill health.\nPoints for Discussion\n a) What do you think is responsible for Sohan’s habit of \nsmoking and why?\n b) Do you think smoking helped reduce Sohan’s stress? \nWhy?\n c) What else could Sohan have done to reduce his stress \neffectively? \n d) What role could Sohan’s parents have played to prevent \nhim from smoking? \nConsequences of substance abuse\nSubstance misuse leads to a number of short-term and long-\nterm effects that are detrimental to health. \nShort-term effects: These are effects that appear only \na few minutes after the intake of substance. The user feels \na false sense of well-being and a pleasant drowsiness.  \nSome of the short-term effects are distorted vision, hearing \nand coordination, impaired judgment, bad breath and \nhangovers.\nChap-10.indd   189 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\n2024-25",

These effects show up over a course of time and are \nusually caused by progressive damage to different body \norgans. Some of the health consequences include irregular \neating habits, sleep disorders, poor hygiene resulting in \npoor health and low immunity. This predisposes substance \nabuser to diseases and infections. \nSubstance abuse in itself is not a cause of HIV/AIDS or \nSTDs but under the influence of drugs, people may engage \nin risk-behaviours that make them more susceptible to \nthese infections. Injectable drug users, however, are more \nprone to HIV in conditions where the users do not sterilise \nneedles and share needles to inject the drug. \nSubstance users may even die suddenly from a so-called \noverdose, when one consumes more than what the body \ncan tolerate. Death may also occur from long-term damage \nto the organs of the body.\nThese substances are especially harmful if consumed \nduring pregnancy. These substances reach the foetus \nthrough blood and harm it by crippling its growth and \ndevelopment or death. \nSubstance abuse influences not only the individual \nand family but also the community. The persons who get \naddicted often lose interest in other activities be it school, \njob or any other responsibility. They are not able to take \ncare of their responsibilities and may become a liability \nfor their families and finally the society. Furthermore, it is \nexpensive to buy substances or drugs on a regular basis. \nHence, in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced \nto engage in petty severe crimes. \nPrevention of drug abuse\nPaying attention to the following may prevent young people \nfrom misusing substances —\n • Peer pressure can be managed by being aware of \nthe implications of substance abuse and developing \nlife skills. One can not only save oneself from \nadopting risky behaviours under peer pressure but \nalso persuade the peers not to engage in unhealthy \nbehaviours such as substance misuse. Advocacy \nwith the involvement of local community can be quite \nuseful.\n • The different ways of dealing with negative peer \npressure are saying ‘No’ assertively, making an \nexcuse, reversal of pressure, and giving reasons.\n • Young people should also be educated to recognise \nthat a friend is someone who cares, protects and looks \nActivity 10.6\nDiscuss how a substance \nabuser’s life gets affected.\nChap-10.indd   190 8/24/2020   11:45:11 AM\n2024-25",

They should be \ntaking well-informed and responsible decisions.\n • The family and society should provide the support \nsystem for young children in their ‘low’ times.\n • As the attitudes related to smoking, drinking and \nmisuse of other substances are formed during \npre-adolescence and early adolescence, this is an \nimportant age to invest in prevention efforts. The \nfamily, community and educational institutions \nshould empower young people with correct and \nscientific information.\nYoung children should be encouraged to get engaged \nin socially productive activities.

It requires physical strength, balance, \ncoordination, endurance, flexibility and body control. It \noften involves dance moves, flips, twists, jumps and other \nmoves. It helps children to develop physical coordination and \nmotor skills, proper use of balance develop a good sense of \nprecision and timing. It can be performed as a way to stay fit \nor specifically to compete in events locally, nationally as well \nas internationally. \nHistory\nGymnastics was developed for fitness and beauty practices \nby the ancient Greeks. It included skills for mounting \nand dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills.  \nThe Greeks used gymnastics as military training. However, \nin the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the \nGerman physical educators created exercises for boys \nand young men on apparatus. Their design is considered \nas modern gymnastics. The Federation of International \nGymnastics was founded in 1881.

At least one static \nstrength move is required, but some gymnast \nincludes two or three strenghts. A routine should \nhave a dismount at the end of routine.\n (iv) Vault: In this, the gymnasts sprint down a runway, \nwhich is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before \nhurdling onto a spring board. The body position is \nmaintained while “punching” (blocking using only a \nshoulder movement) the vaulting board. The \ngymnast then rotates to a standing position. Multiple \ntwists and somersaults are added before landing in \ncase of advance gymnastics. Vaults depend on the \nspeed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power \nthe gymnast generated from the legs and shoulder \ngirdle and the kinesthetic awareness in the air. In \ncase of more difficult and complex vaults the speed \nof rotation is more important.\n (v) Parallel Bars: Men perform \non two bars. These are \nkept slightly further than \na shoulder’s width apart \nand usually 1.75 m high. \nFor executing a series \nof swings, balances, \nand releases require \ngreat strength and co-\nordination.\n (vi) Horizontal Bar: A 2.8 cm thick steel or fiberglass \nbar raised 2.5m above the landing area is all the \ngymnasts have to hold onto as they perform giants \n(revolutions around the bar), release skills, twists, \nand changes of direction. By using all of the \nmomentum from giants and then releasing at the \nproper point, enough height can be achieved for \nspectacular dismounts. Leather grips are usually \nused to help maintain a grip on the bar."

Every gymnast starts at a different point \non the vault runway depending on her height and \nstrength. The post flight segment may include one \nor more multiple somersaults, and/or twisting \nmovements. In vaults with round-off entries, \ngymnasts “round-off” so that hands are on the \nrunway while the feet land on the springboard. \nFrom the round-off position the gymnast travels \nbackwards as in a back handspring so that the \nhands land on the vaulting platform (horse).  \nShe then blocks off the vaulting platform into \nvarious twisting and somersaulting combinations.\n (iii) Uneven Bars: On the uneven bars (also known as \nasymmetric bars), the gymnast performs a routine \non two horizontal bars set at different heights. The \nheight is generally fixed, but the width may be \nadjusted. Gymnasts perform swinging, circling, \ntransitional, and release moves, as well as moves \nthat pass through the handstand. Usually in higher \nlevels of gymnastics, leather grips are worn to ensure \nthat the gymnast maintains a grip on the bar, and \nto protect the hands from blisters and tears. \n (iv) Balance Beam: The gymnast performs a \nchoreographed routine from 70 to 90 seconds \nin length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills, \nturns and dance elements on a padded spring \nbeam. Apparatus norms set by the International \nGymnastics Federation specify that the beam \nmust be 125 cm (4’) high, 500 cm (16’) long, and \n10 cm (4.5”) wide.

        "content": "and defensive including backhand and forehand.\n (i) Offensive strokes (drive, loop drive, loop, loop kill, \nhook, counter drive, flip and smash)\n a) Drive: The racket is primarily perpendicular \nto the direction of the stroke, and most of the \nenergy applied to the ball results in speed \nrather than spin, creating a shot that does \nnot arc much, but it is fast enough to make it \ndifficult to return.\n b) Loop drive: The racket is much more parallel \nto the direction of the stroke (closed) and the \nracket thus grazes the ball, resulting in a large \namount of topspin. Variations in spin and \nspeed add to the effectiveness of this shot. \n c) Loop: The loop produces a more pronounced \nloopy arc, with a higher trajectory and extreme \ntopspin, but is typically slower.\n d) Loop kill: The loop kill produces a flatter arc, \nwith higher speed that resembles a speed \ndrive but with stronger topspin.\n e) Hook: It is similar  to a regular Loop, but carries \na tilted topspin (or is referred as the “top-side” \nspin), it bounces sideways and downward \nupon hitting the table. \n f) Counter drive: It is a counter attack against \ndrives (normally high loop drives). One has \nChap-5.indd   63 8/24/2020   11:38:38 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n64\nto bring close to the racket and stay close to \nthe ball (try to predict its path). The racket is \nheld closed and near to the ball, which is hit \nwith a short movement off the bounce (before \nreaching the highest point) so that the ball \ntravels faster to the other side.\n g) Flip: When a player tries to attack a ball that \nhas not bounced beyond the edge of the table, \nhowever the ball may still be attacked, and the \nresulting shot is called flip because the back \nswing is compressed into a quick wrist action. \n h) Smash: Smash is executed when his or her \nopponent has returned a ball that bounces too \nhigh and/ or too close to the net. Smashing \nis a large back swing and rapid acceleration \nimparting as much speed on the ball as possible. \n (ii) Defensive strokes\n a) Push or Slice: The push is usually used for \nkeeping the point alive and creating offensive \nopportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice, \nthe racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting \nbackspin and causing the ball to float slowly \nto the other side of the table. Offensive players \nshould only push for variation and not for \ngeneral rallies. \n b) Chop: A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin \ncounterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop \nis essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well \nback from the table. Sometimes a defensive \nplayer can impart no spin on the ball during \na chop, or frequently add right- or left-hand \nspin to the ball. This may further confuse his/\nher opponent. \n c) Block: A block is executed by simply putting \nthe racket in front of the ball, the ball rebounds \nback toward the opponent with nearly as \nmuch energy as it came in with. This is not \nas easy as it sounds, because the ball’s spin, \nspeed, and location, all influence the correct \nangle of a block. \n d) Side spin drive: The premise of this move is to \nput a spin on the ball either to the right or the \nleft of the racket. The execution of this move \nis similar to a slice, but to the right or left, \ninstead of down. This spin will result in the ball \ncurving to the side but bouncing in the opposite \ndirection when the opponent returns it. \nChap-5.indd   64 8/24/2020   11:38:38 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nIndIvIdual Games and sports II\n65\n e) Lob: The defensive High Ball or Lob is \ndeceptive in its simplicity. To execute a High \nBall, a defensive player first backs off the table \n8-10 meters; then, the stroke itself consists of \nsimply lifting the ball to an enormous height \nbefore it falls back to the opponent’s side of \nthe table. A High Ball is inherently a creative \nshot, and can have nearly any kind of spin.\n f) Drop shot: The drop shot is a high level stroke, \nused as another variation for close-to-table \nstrokes. The player has position the racket close \nto the ball and just let the ball touch it (without \nany hand movement) in a way that the ball stays \nclose to the net with almost no speed and spin, \nand touches the other side of the table more \nthan twice if the opponent doesn’t reach it. \nSkills\nForehand drive\n • Keep arm close to the torso.\n • Forearm makes 90° with the upper arm.\n • Draw the forearm back to another 45°.\n • Let the waist turn naturally along with the arm and \nshift your weight towards the right foot.\n • Swing forward with a slight upward motion while \nshifting your weight back to left foot.\n • Elbow should be used as a pivot point and should only \nmove a little forward in the follow through.\nFig. 5.11: Forehand drive\nBackhand drive\n • Form ready position.\n • Turn waist towards left with Racket towards 9 O’clock \nposition.\n • Contact with the ball is made in front of the body \nslightly after the top of the bounce.\nChap-5.indd   65 8/24/2020   11:38:42 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n66\n • Elbow acts as pivot point.\n • Snap the forearm forward in slightly upward direction.\n • Power comes with the flick of the wrist.\n • Follow through until the racket points after the ball.\nFig. 5.12: Backhand drive\nBlocking \nIt is a backup shot, when there isn’t enough time for a full \ndrive or loop. This stroke allows the players to use opponent \nforce against them.\n • Adjust the racket angle according to the severity of top \nspin. More the spin, more one should close the racket.\n • Involve a little backspin and follow through.\n • Execute immediately after the bounce to keep control \nand speed.\n • Hit the ball as it is rising off the surface of the table on \nyour side using 50 per cent of the stroke action before \nhitting the ball and 50 per cent after hitting the ball.\nFig. 5.13: Blocking\ntennis\nTennis is one of the most popular individual sports in the \nworld.

The world’s oldest tennis \ntournament, the Wimbledon Championships were first played \nin London in 1877. The comprehensive rules promulgated \nin 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation, now \nknown as the International Tennis Federation, have remained \nlargely stable, one of the major changes being the addition of \nthe tie-back system. The Davis Cup, an annual competition \nbetween men’s national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous \ncompetition for women’s national teams, the Fed Cup, was \nfounded as the Federation Cup in 1963. There are four top \ntournaments called the Grand Slam Tournaments, these \nare Wimbledon, the US Open, the Australian Open, and the \nFrench Open. \nChap-5.indd   67 8/24/2020   11:38:49 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n68\nRules\nThe following are the rules regarding equipment, balls, court, \nlines and scoring:"

        "content": " (i) Racquets: Tennis racquet must adhere to the \nfollowing guidelines — \n • The hitting area, composed of the strings, \nmust be flat and generally uniform.\n • The frame of the hitting area may not be more \nthan 29 inches in length and 12.5 inches in \nwidth.\n • The entire racquet must be of a fixed shape, \nsize, weight, and weight distribution. There \nmay not be any energy source built into the \nracquet.\n • The racquet must not provide any kind of \ncommunication, instruction or advice to the \nplayer during the match.\n (ii) Balls: Tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a \nfelt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant \ncolour was gradually changed to optic yellow in \nthe latter part of the 20th century to ensure better \nvisibility.\n (iii) Court\n • Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface, \nusually grass or clay, a hard court of concrete \nand/or asphalt and occasionally carpet \n(indoor). The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, \nand 27 feet (8.23 m) wide for singles matches \nand 36 ft (10.97 m) for doubles’ matches. \n • Additional clear space around the court is \nrequired for players so as to reach over run \nballs. \n • A net is stretched across the full width of the \ncourt, parallel with the baselines, dividing it \ninto two equal ends. The net is 3 feet 6 inches \n(1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (91.4 cm) \nhigh in the center. \n (iv) Lines\n • The lines that delineate the width of the court \nare called the baseline (farthest back) and the \nservice line (middle of the court). \n • The short mark in the center of each baseline \nis referred to as either the hash mark or the \ncenter mark. \nChap-5.indd   68 8/24/2020   11:38:49 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nIndIvIdual Games and sports II\n69\n • The outermost lines that make up the length \nare called the doubles’ sidelines. These are \nthe boundaries used when doubles is being \nplayed. \n • The lines to the inside of the doubles’ \nsidelines are the singles’ sidelines and used as \nboundaries in singles’ play. The area between \na doubles’ sideline and the nearest singles’ \nsideline is called the doubles’ alley, which is \nconsidered playable in doubles’ play. \n • The line that runs across the center of a \nplayer’s side of the court is called the service \nline because the serve must be delivered into \nthe area between the service line and the net \non the receiving side. \n • All the lines are required to be 2 inches  \n(51 mm) in width. The baseline can be up to 4 \ninches (100 mm) wide if so desired. \n (v) Scoring\n • The players (or teams) start on opposite sides \nof the net. One player is designated as the \nserver, and the opposing player is the receiver. \n • A tennis match is determined through the \nbest of 3 or 5 sets. Women play 3 set matches, \nwhile men play 5 set matches. For men, the \nfirst player to win three sets wins the match, \nand for women, the first player to win two sets \nwins the match.\n • A set consists of games, and a game, in turn, \nconsists of a sequence of points played with \nthe same player serving. \n • A game is won by the first player to have won \nat least four points in total and at least two \npoints more than the opponent. \n • The running score of each game is described \nin a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from \nzero to three points are described as “love”, \n“15”, “30”, and “40” respectively \n • If at least three points have been scored by \neach player, making the player’s score equal \nat 40 a piece, the score is not called out as \n“40-40”, but rather as “deuce”. \n • If at least three points have been scored by \neach side and a player has one more point \nthan the opponent, the score of the game is \n“advantage” for the player in the lead. \nChap-5.indd   69 8/24/2020   11:38:49 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n70\n • A game point occurs in tennis whenever \nthe player who is in the lead in the game \nneeds only one more point to win the game. \nThe terminology is extended to sets (set \npoint), matches (match point), and even \nchampionships (championship point). \n • A break point occurs if the receiver, not the \nsever, has a chance to win the game with \nthe next point. Break points are of particular \nimportance because serving is generally \nconsidered advantageous, with the server being \nexpected to win games in which they are serving. \n • A receiver who has one (score of 30–40), two \n(score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) \nconsecutive chances to win the game has \nbreak point, double break point or triple break \npoint, respectively.\n • If the leading player wins that game, the player \nwins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins \nthe game, a tie-break is played. A tie-break, \nplayed under a separate set of rules, allows \none player to win one more game and thus the \nset, to give a final set score of 7–6. \n • In tournament play, the chair umpire \nannounces the winner of the set and the \noverall score."

Swimming \nimproves cardiovascular system and places minimum stress \non joints. It employs major muscle groups of the body leading \nto a well-developed flexible muscular system. Swimming is \nalso important for physical rehabilitation for people suffering \nfrom disabilities or those recovering from injuries.\nFig. 5.15: Swimming\nHistory\nSwimming is a sport that was included in the first modern \nOlympic Games at Athens in 1896, diving events were \nadded in 1904 and women’s competitions were recognised \nin 1912. FINA (Federation International de Notation) was \nformed at London Olympic in 1908 AD. National Swimming \nAssociation of India was founded in 1949. Swimming \nwas one of the six sports at the First Asian Games held \nat Delhi in 1951. The aquatic sport of swimming involves \ncompetition amongst participants to be the fastest over a \ngiven distance. Different di stances are covered in different \nlevels of competition.\nRules\n • A swimmer must finish the race in the same lane. \nSwimming across another lane or interfering with the \nother shall disqualify the offender.\n • During a turn the swimmer shall touch the end of  \nthe pool.\n • A swimmer should not walk. \n • Any swimmer not participating in a race, who enters the \nwater in which an event is being conducted before all \nswimmers shall be disqualified from the next scheduled \nrace in the meet.\nDo You Know?\nThe current Olympic \ngames contain freestyle \nevents of 50m, 100m, \n200m, 400m, 800m, \nand 1500m; 100m and \n200m events in each of \nbackstroke, breaststroke \nand butterfly; 200m \nIndividual Medley \n(that is, 50m butterfly, \n50m backstroke, 50m \nbreaststroke, and \n50m freestyle); 400m \nIndividual Medley \n(100m butterfly, 100m \nbackstroke, 100m \nbreaststroke, and 100m \nfreestyle); and the \nMarathon 10km.\nChap-5.indd   71 8/24/2020   11:38:50 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 21 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n72\n • There shall be four swimmers in each relay team. In \nrelay events, the team of swimmers whose feet lose \ntouch with the starting platform before the preceding \nteammate touches the wall shall be disqualified. Any \nrelay team shall be disqualified from a race if a team \nmember, other than the swimmer designated to swim \nthat length, enters the water when the race is being \nconducted, before swimmers of all teams have finished \nthe race. The member of a relay team and their order \nof competing must be nominated before the race. Any \nrelay team member may compete in a race only once. \n • The composition of a relay team may be changed \nbetween the heats and finals of the event, provided that \nit is made up from the list of swimmers properly entered \nby a member for that event. Failure to swim in the \norder listed will result in disqualification. Substitutions \nmay be made only in the case of a documented  \nmedical emergency.\n • Any swimmer having finished the race, or the stipulated \ndistance in a relay event, must leave the pool as soon \nas possible without obstructing any other swimmer \nwho has not yet finished the race. Otherwise the \nswimmer committing the fault or the relay team shall \nbe disqualified.\n • Should a foul endanger the chances of success of a \nswimmer, the referees shall have the power to allow the \nswimmer to compete in the next heat or, should the \nfoul occur in a final event or in the last heat, they may \norder it to be re-swim.\nFundamental techniques\nTechniques in swimming are strokes, starts and turns.\nStrokes\nIn swimming there are four competitive strokes (Front \nCrawl, Back Crawl, Breast stroke and Butterfly stroke) being \nfollowed all over the world. All the above mentioned strokes \nhave been learnt in the previous class.\nStarts\nAll four competitive strokes are to be started in the competition \nby using the technique known as start. The swimmers \nemphasis on the quickest technique, which allows him a \nstronger push off from the starting position. The starting \ntechniques, popular today, are: (i) Grab start (ii) Circular \nstart (iii) Racings start (iv) Conventional start (v) Tuck start. \nThe following sequence is followed; (i) Position on the block \n(ii) Take off (iii) Flight (position in air) (iv) Entry into the water \nChap-5.indd   72 8/24/2020   11:38:50 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 22 ---\nIndIvIdual Games and sports II\n73\n(v) Glide (vi) First stroke. However, backstroke uses almost \na uniform technique, which does not have any special name \nand is known as backstroke start.\nTurns\nDuring the race, the swimmer must take a turn from the end \nof the wall to complete the full distance. The swimmers try \nto use a technique that is quicker and gives a strong push \noff from the wall within the permissible rules of the stroke. \nThe various turns used by swimmers are: (i) Simple turn  \n(ii) Throw away turn (iii) Summer Sault turn (iv) Flip turn (v) \nRoll over turn (vi) Breast stroke turn (vii) Butterfly turn. \nThe following sequence is followed in the turn: (i) Approach \nto the wall (ii) Turn or touch (iii) Push off (iv) Glide (v) First \nstroke.\nTactics\nSwimming is an individual and cyclic sport. It is highly \ncompetitive with the application of science. It is getting \ntransformed from an art to science. Now, the importance is \ngiven to strategy and tactics for completing and pacing the \nrace. In order to achieve the best performance, a swimmer \nmust learn to distribute the distance economically and \nthoughtfully throughout the race. Tactics in swimming \nduring different races can be categorised in three different \nphase —  (i) Sprint races (ii) Middle distance races (iii) Long \ndistance races\nSprint races\nThe 50 m race or the sprint race depends on the start, \nmaintaining the speed and a good finish.\nMiddle and Long distance races\nIn these races, the key word is to build endurance and speed. \nIn middle and long distance races, the swimmer tries to \nprevent building up high oxygen debt. Swimming at a very \nfast pace will accumulate a high level of oxygen debt early \nin the race and will experience an immediate drop in speed. \nSwimmer may sometimes prefer to begin faster than an ideal \npace and attempt to get out in front avoiding the choppy \nwaters. Some swimmers like to swim the strategy races in \nrelation to the opponent.\nChap-5.indd   73 8/24/2020   11:38:50 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 23 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n74\nassessment\nBadminton\n I.

It will help the \nplayer to receive all types of serves i.e. high, low and \nflick. In fact, players are advised to take the stance \ncloser to the short service because in high serve the \nshuttle remains in the air for a longer duration. On \na high serve, a player has the choice of playing an \nattacking clear, drop shot, smash or a half smash. \nSimilarly, on a low serve, a player can flick, push or \nlift the shuttle to the baseline. It is important to try \nto meet the shuttle as close to the net as possible so \nthat the receiver has more options available to choose  \nthe shots. \nGymnastics\nGymnastics is a sport that involves physical movements \nin a sequence.

It included skills for mounting \nand dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills.  \nThe Greeks used gymnastics as military training. However, \nin the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the \nGerman physical educators created exercises for boys \nand young men on apparatus.

Every gymnast starts at a different point \non the vault runway depending on her height and \nstrength. The post flight segment may include one \nor more multiple somersaults, and/or twisting \nmovements. In vaults with round-off entries, \ngymnasts “round-off” so that hands are on the \nrunway while the feet land on the springboard. \nFrom the round-off position the gymnast travels \nbackwards as in a back handspring so that the \nhands land on the vaulting platform (horse).  \nShe then blocks off the vaulting platform into \nvarious twisting and somersaulting combinations.\n (iii) Uneven Bars: On the uneven bars (also known as \nasymmetric bars), the gymnast performs a routine \non two horizontal bars set at different heights. The \nheight is generally fixed, but the width may be \nadjusted. Gymnasts perform swinging, circling, \ntransitional, and release moves, as well as moves \nthat pass through the handstand. Usually in higher \nlevels of gymnastics, leather grips are worn to ensure \nthat the gymnast maintains a grip on the bar, and \nto protect the hands from blisters and tears. \n (iv) Balance Beam: The gymnast performs a \nchoreographed routine from 70 to 90 seconds \nin length consisting of leaps, acrobatic skills, \nturns and dance elements on a padded spring \nbeam.

Variations in spin and \nspeed add to the effectiveness of this shot. \n c) Loop: The loop produces a more pronounced \nloopy arc, with a higher trajectory and extreme \ntopspin, but is typically slower.\n d) Loop kill: The loop kill produces a flatter arc, \nwith higher speed that resembles a speed \ndrive but with stronger topspin.\n e) Hook: It is similar  to a regular Loop, but carries \na tilted topspin (or is referred as the “top-side” \nspin), it bounces sideways and downward \nupon hitting the table. \n f) Counter drive: It is a counter attack against \ndrives (normally high loop drives).

The racket is \nheld closed and near to the ball, which is hit \nwith a short movement off the bounce (before \nreaching the highest point) so that the ball \ntravels faster to the other side.\n g) Flip: When a player tries to attack a ball that \nhas not bounced beyond the edge of the table, \nhowever the ball may still be attacked, and the \nresulting shot is called flip because the back \nswing is compressed into a quick wrist action. \n h) Smash: Smash is executed when his or her \nopponent has returned a ball that bounces too \nhigh and/ or too close to the net. Smashing \nis a large back swing and rapid acceleration \nimparting as much speed on the ball as possible. \n (ii) Defensive strokes\n a) Push or Slice: The push is usually used for \nkeeping the point alive and creating offensive \nopportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice, \nthe racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting \nbackspin and causing the ball to float slowly \nto the other side of the table. Offensive players \nshould only push for variation and not for \ngeneral rallies. \n b) Chop: A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin \ncounterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop \nis essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well \nback from the table. Sometimes a defensive \nplayer can impart no spin on the ball during \na chop, or frequently add right- or left-hand \nspin to the ball. This may further confuse his/\nher opponent. \n c) Block: A block is executed by simply putting \nthe racket in front of the ball, the ball rebounds \nback toward the opponent with nearly as \nmuch energy as it came in with. This is not \nas easy as it sounds, because the ball’s spin, \nspeed, and location, all influence the correct \nangle of a block. \n d) Side spin drive: The premise of this move is to \nput a spin on the ball either to the right or the \nleft of the racket. The execution of this move \nis similar to a slice, but to the right or left, \ninstead of down. This spin will result in the ball \ncurving to the side but bouncing in the opposite \ndirection when the opponent returns it. \nChap-5.indd   64 8/24/2020   11:38:38 AM\n2024-25",

To execute a High \nBall, a defensive player first backs off the table \n8-10 meters; then, the stroke itself consists of \nsimply lifting the ball to an enormous height \nbefore it falls back to the opponent’s side of \nthe table. A High Ball is inherently a creative \nshot, and can have nearly any kind of spin.\n f) Drop shot: The drop shot is a high level stroke, \nused as another variation for close-to-table \nstrokes. The player has position the racket close \nto the ball and just let the ball touch it (without \nany hand movement) in a way that the ball stays \nclose to the net with almost no speed and spin, \nand touches the other side of the table more \nthan twice if the opponent doesn’t reach it. \nSkills\nForehand drive\n • Keep arm close to the torso.\n • Forearm makes 90° with the upper arm.\n • Draw the forearm back to another 45°.\n • Let the waist turn naturally along with the arm and \nshift your weight towards the right foot.\n • Swing forward with a slight upward motion while \nshifting your weight back to left foot.\n • Elbow should be used as a pivot point and should only \nmove a little forward in the follow through.\nFig. 5.11: Forehand drive\nBackhand drive\n • Form ready position.\n • Turn waist towards left with Racket towards 9 O’clock \nposition.\n • Contact with the ball is made in front of the body \nslightly after the top of the bounce.\nChap-5.indd   65 8/24/2020   11:38:42 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n66\n • Elbow acts as pivot point.\n • Snap the forearm forward in slightly upward direction.\n • Power comes with the flick of the wrist.\n • Follow through until the racket points after the ball.\nFig. 5.12: Backhand drive\nBlocking \nIt is a backup shot, when there isn’t enough time for a full \ndrive or loop.

There \nmay not be any energy source built into the \nracquet.\n • The racquet must not provide any kind of \ncommunication, instruction or advice to the \nplayer during the match.\n (ii) Balls: Tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a \nfelt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant \ncolour was gradually changed to optic yellow in \nthe latter part of the 20th century to ensure better \nvisibility.\n (iii) Court\n • Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface, \nusually grass or clay, a hard court of concrete \nand/or asphalt and occasionally carpet \n(indoor). The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, \nand 27 feet (8.23 m) wide for singles matches \nand 36 ft (10.97 m) for doubles’ matches. \n • Additional clear space around the court is \nrequired for players so as to reach over run \nballs. \n • A net is stretched across the full width of the \ncourt, parallel with the baselines, dividing it \ninto two equal ends. The net is 3 feet 6 inches \n(1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (91.4 cm) \nhigh in the center. \n (iv) Lines\n • The lines that delineate the width of the court \nare called the baseline (farthest back) and the \nservice line (middle of the court). \n • The short mark in the center of each baseline \nis referred to as either the hash mark or the \ncenter mark. \nChap-5.indd   68 8/24/2020   11:38:49 AM\n2024-25",

Otherwise the \nswimmer committing the fault or the relay team shall \nbe disqualified.\n • Should a foul endanger the chances of success of a \nswimmer, the referees shall have the power to allow the \nswimmer to compete in the next heat or, should the \nfoul occur in a final event or in the last heat, they may \norder it to be re-swim.\nFundamental techniques\nTechniques in swimming are strokes, starts and turns.\nStrokes\nIn swimming there are four competitive strokes (Front \nCrawl, Back Crawl, Breast stroke and Butterfly stroke) being \nfollowed all over the world. All the above mentioned strokes \nhave been learnt in the previous class.\nStarts\nAll four competitive strokes are to be started in the competition \nby using the technique known as start. The swimmers \nemphasis on the quickest technique, which allows him a \nstronger push off from the starting position. The starting \ntechniques, popular today, are: (i) Grab start (ii) Circular \nstart (iii) Racings start (iv) Conventional start (v) Tuck start. \nThe following sequence is followed; (i) Position on the block \n(ii) Take off (iii) Flight (position in air) (iv) Entry into the water \nChap-5.indd   72 8/24/2020   11:38:50 AM\n2024-25",

However, backstroke uses almost \na uniform technique, which does not have any special name \nand is known as backstroke start.\nTurns\nDuring the race, the swimmer must take a turn from the end \nof the wall to complete the full distance. The swimmers try \nto use a technique that is quicker and gives a strong push \noff from the wall within the permissible rules of the stroke. \nThe various turns used by swimmers are: (i) Simple turn  \n(ii) Throw away turn (iii) Summer Sault turn (iv) Flip turn (v) \nRoll over turn (vi) Breast stroke turn (vii) Butterfly turn. \nThe following sequence is followed in the turn: (i) Approach \nto the wall (ii) Turn or touch (iii) Push off (iv) Glide (v) First \nstroke.\nTactics\nSwimming is an individual and cyclic sport. It is highly \ncompetitive with the application of science. It is getting \ntransformed from an art to science. Now, the importance is \ngiven to strategy and tactics for completing and pacing the \nrace. In order to achieve the best performance, a swimmer \nmust learn to distribute the distance economically and \nthoughtfully throughout the race. Tactics in swimming \nduring different races can be categorised in three different \nphase —  (i) Sprint races (ii) Middle distance races (iii) Long \ndistance races\nSprint races\nThe 50 m race or the sprint race depends on the start, \nmaintaining the speed and a good finish.\nMiddle and Long distance races\nIn these races, the key word is to build endurance and speed. \nIn middle and long distance races, the swimmer tries to \nprevent building up high oxygen debt. Swimming at a very \nfast pace will accumulate a high level of oxygen debt early \nin the race and will experience an immediate drop in speed. \nSwimmer may sometimes prefer to begin faster than an ideal \npace and attempt to get out in front avoiding the choppy \nwaters. Some swimmers like to swim the strategy races in \nrelation to the opponent.\nChap-5.indd   73 8/24/2020   11:38:50 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 23 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n74\nassessment\nBadminton\n I.

Would you agree that the country’s \nconstitution provides for Justice, Liberty, Equality and \nFraternity which should be adopted in life for living happily \nand having consideration for all others in the group? Let us \nunderstand these four terms of our constitution which are \ndirectly related to “social health of a person or a country”, \nand then try to define social health. In other words, if one is \nsocially healthy, than will be able to develop interpersonal \nrelations, through maintaining equality, fraternity and \njustice.\nLet us now try and define social health.\nDefinition  of ‘social health’\nSocial health may be defined as the ability to form satisfying \ninterpersonal relationships with others.  One who is able to \nmake positive relationships and acquires the ability to adapt \nin different social situations and act appropriately as per \nthe situation concerned, and can be called a socially healthy \nperson. \nNeed for developing social health\nPrimitive humans were hunter-gatherers, who lived in small \ngroups or clusters and spent their lives at individual levels. \nAround 10,000 years ago, they moved near rivers to grow \ntheir own food and began to live together. With the passage \nof time, they started to live in a society and developed a \nlanguage for interaction with each other. As ‘human society’ \nprogressed, an individual became part of many social groups \nfor example a member of a peer group, a family and kin, a class \nin school, a native of a region and a citizen of one’s country. \nSocial changes occur from time to time and many societies \nlay down norms and values for group living. Urbanisation \nhas brought about many changes which are different from \ntraditional rural societies.\nSocial attributes, of people however, remain the same \nas they are based on interrelationship between members of \nany society and necessary for accomplishing tasks requiring \nteamwork. School is one of the platforms for learning social \nskills.\nRole of vaRious institutions\nPromotion of social health among children requires collective \nefforts and appropriate skills. All people in the field of \neducation have to think about this.\nChap-12.indd   208 8/24/2020   11:46:39 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nSocial HealtH\n209\nRole of teacher training institutes and other \norganisations\nSchool teachers need a degree, diploma or certificates from a \nteacher training institute. There are a number of organisation \nconcerned with school education. The syllabus of teacher \ntraining courses should include the topics of important \nissues for children of which health should be one. \nOrganisations such as NCERT, SCERT, DIET should \nperiodically organise workshops, publish journals and \nprovide inservice training programmes on health issues \nincluding social health.\nRole of schools in promoting social health\nSchools have a very significant role to play in the promotion \nof health and safety of children. They spend a lot of time \nin school in early years. School environment forms ideal \nsetting for acquiring knowledge of healthy choices of food. It \nis in school that they participate in physical activity through \nsports, games, yoga, gymnastics, exercise and gain benefits \nof each. School helps children to learn social skills which \nassist in establishing lifelong healthy behavior. Children \nlearn team spirit and training in rules and regulations of \nsocial wellbeing just as in the defense services, which are \ninbuilt in training of defense service personnel, so they work \ntogether as a team to protect our nation.\nIn order to promote social health, the school should \nhave a positive environment where children mingle with \nteachers, peer group and non-teaching staff without fear and \napprehensions. Teacher have a significant role in this regard.\nRole of teachers\nIt is well known that teachers are the mentors and therefore, \nthe teacher training institutes should make training in \nleadership and mentorship a part of teacher training. Also well \nknown saying that ‘example in better than precept’ Students \neasily learn to be socially healthy if the teacher herself or \nhimself sets an example rather than lecture on social health. \nA good teacher ensures that students grow up into physically, \nmentally and socially healthy individuals. In doing this the \nteacher has to make efforts to ensure that students —\n (i) eat a proper diet and perform regular exercise and \nphysical activity which are requirements of good \nphysical health. \n (ii) inculcate friendship between classmates, indulge \nin amicable behavior with others in school so that \nstudents develop a helpful nature. These are necessary \nfor mental and emotional health. \nChap-12.indd   209 8/24/2020   11:46:40 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n210"

This makes children \nacquire ability to live harmoniously in the society.\nRole of technology in building social health\nTechnology has made communication convenient through \nMobiles, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and E-mail \nmessages. Knowledge about different media can help to \ndevelop the skills to access the appropriate media for \naccurate information on a specific topic or issues. More \nso, because media brings awareness, and provides access \nto global knowledge and learning. But refrain from using \nmobiles and viewing the T.V. for long periods as that tends \nto be counter-productive and reduce interaction time with \nothers. This makes us socially withdrawn. Although media is \na source of information, all of it may not be true or reliable. \nIt is advisable to seek guidenes from a trusted adult while \naccessing media and internet. Moreover, there is a need to \nunderstand about real and fake news or information as these \naffects our attitude and behavior.\nRole of students in building habits of social health\nSocial health comes from social skills. A few important \nguidelines for promoting social skills are outlined below.\n (i) Building self awareness is an important skill: Practice \nself-care by developing habits of cleanliness and \nhygiene, keeping away from substance abuse, \nengaging in physical activity and regularly consuming \na balanced diet.\n (ii) Do not be blameful and judgmental: Remember when \nyou point a finger at others, three fingers of yours \npoint towards you. Hence indulge in knowing yourself \nbetter. It helps to discriminate between a good \nand a bad act of yours and helps to make friends. \nEmpathy and self awareness go hand in hand.  \nWhen you seea child hitting an animal, tell that \nChap-12.indd   210 8/24/2020   11:46:40 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nSocial HealtH\n211\nchild that if they were hit, they would feel the same \npain. That is empathy for others and leads to self  \nawareness.\n (iii) Learn to identify your own mistakes: There is no harm \nin saying sorry for a mistake and rectifying it. People \nwill have faith in you if you did so.\n (iv) Make an effort to reconnect with old relationships and \nfriendships: The socially healthy person makes an \neffort to contact and meet old friends, to remember \nenjoyable periods of childhood which can be a good \nway to beat stress and spend leisure time. \n (v) Appreciate yourself and others: But never let your ego \nrule your behaviour which can sometimes drive you \nto lose a relationship.\n (vi) Try and be respectful, positive and supportive towards \nthe needy, the physically and mentally challenged, the \ndowntrodden and those belonging to faith and cultures \nother than yours. Lend an ear to others opinion. It \nteaches tolerance. Tolerance and appreciation are \nvirtues in socially healthy individuals. \nRole of family in inculcating social skills in young \nfamily members\nThe importance of family in inculcating social skills among, \nchildren is paramount. Guardians or parents are the prime \nteachers and caretakers who feed them healthy food and are \nalso their play mates. They have to be aware themselves to \nbe role model and make children appreciate as they grow.  \nThe benefits of enjoying nutritious food and being aware \nof a balanced diet is of paramount importance. Watching \nof television for longer duration is bad for students. \nParents themselves have to be cautious in what they do \nin front of children and how long they are in front of the \nTV. However, at the same time good TV programmes are \nan avenue for learning. Encourage them to indulge in \nphysical activity to build their muscles and bones. Fit body \nand fitness depends primarily on proper diet and healthy \nbody and mind. The parents and elder family members \nneed to guide them in social skills. Parents and elders \nhave to be accessible to children for necessary guidance.  \nThey  form a “safety network’. They are to guide adolescents \nthrough advice, answer their queries and occupy them \nthrough activities to keep them away from involvement \nin addictive substances like tobacco, drugs and alcohol \nwhich they might believe are helpful in tiding over stress. \nHowever, these substances have deleterious effects on the  \ngrowing body.\nChap-12.indd   211 8/24/2020   11:46:40 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n212\nWhat aRe life skills ?\nThese are —\n • Empathy: Is the ability to understand another’s feelings \nin a particular situation.\n • Self Awareness: Is the recognition of one’s character, \nstrengths, areas of growth, beliefs and values.\n • Effective Communication: Is having skills of \ncommunication that facilitate interaction with people \nin positive ways.\n • Interpersonal Relationships: Building relationships of \nfriendship and goodwill with all others.\n • Problem solving: Is the ability to resolve challenges.\n • Decision Making: Is the quality of analyzing problem to \nfind and act to reach an appropriate solution.\n • Creative thinking: Is the ability to do something in a \nnovel manner.\n • Critical Thinking: Is the capacity to analyse multiple \nperspectives and objectively evaluate the same.\n • Coping with Stress and emotional distress: These refer \nto management and regulation of one’s emotions and \nmoments of stress.\nAll these life skills help to develop desirable social health \nand live happily in a society.

Would you agree that the country’s \nconstitution provides for Justice, Liberty, Equality and \nFraternity which should be adopted in life for living happily \nand having consideration for all others in the group? Let us \nunderstand these four terms of our constitution which are \ndirectly related to “social health of a person or a country”, \nand then try to define social health. In other words, if one is \nsocially healthy, than will be able to develop interpersonal \nrelations, through maintaining equality, fraternity and \njustice.\nLet us now try and define social health.\nDefinition  of ‘social health’\nSocial health may be defined as the ability to form satisfying \ninterpersonal relationships with others.  One who is able to \nmake positive relationships and acquires the ability to adapt \nin different social situations and act appropriately as per \nthe situation concerned, and can be called a socially healthy \nperson. \nNeed for developing social health\nPrimitive humans were hunter-gatherers, who lived in small \ngroups or clusters and spent their lives at individual levels. \nAround 10,000 years ago, they moved near rivers to grow \ntheir own food and began to live together. With the passage \nof time, they started to live in a society and developed a \nlanguage for interaction with each other. As ‘human society’ \nprogressed, an individual became part of many social groups \nfor example a member of a peer group, a family and kin, a class \nin school, a native of a region and a citizen of one’s country. \nSocial changes occur from time to time and many societies \nlay down norms and values for group living. Urbanisation \nhas brought about many changes which are different from \ntraditional rural societies.\nSocial attributes, of people however, remain the same \nas they are based on interrelationship between members of \nany society and necessary for accomplishing tasks requiring \nteamwork. School is one of the platforms for learning social \nskills.\nRole of vaRious institutions\nPromotion of social health among children requires collective \nefforts and appropriate skills. All people in the field of \neducation have to think about this.\nChap-12.indd   208 8/24/2020   11:46:39 AM\n2024-25",

There are a number of organisation \nconcerned with school education. The syllabus of teacher \ntraining courses should include the topics of important \nissues for children of which health should be one. \nOrganisations such as NCERT, SCERT, DIET should \nperiodically organise workshops, publish journals and \nprovide inservice training programmes on health issues \nincluding social health.\nRole of schools in promoting social health\nSchools have a very significant role to play in the promotion \nof health and safety of children. They spend a lot of time \nin school in early years. School environment forms ideal \nsetting for acquiring knowledge of healthy choices of food. It \nis in school that they participate in physical activity through \nsports, games, yoga, gymnastics, exercise and gain benefits \nof each. School helps children to learn social skills which \nassist in establishing lifelong healthy behavior. Children \nlearn team spirit and training in rules and regulations of \nsocial wellbeing just as in the defense services, which are \ninbuilt in training of defense service personnel, so they work \ntogether as a team to protect our nation.\nIn order to promote social health, the school should \nhave a positive environment where children mingle with \nteachers, peer group and non-teaching staff without fear and \napprehensions. Teacher have a significant role in this regard.\nRole of teachers\nIt is well known that teachers are the mentors and therefore, \nthe teacher training institutes should make training in \nleadership and mentorship a part of teacher training. Also well \nknown saying that ‘example in better than precept’ Students \neasily learn to be socially healthy if the teacher herself or \nhimself sets an example rather than lecture on social health. \nA good teacher ensures that students grow up into physically, \nmentally and socially healthy individuals. In doing this the \nteacher has to make efforts to ensure that students —\n (i) eat a proper diet and perform regular exercise and \nphysical activity which are requirements of good \nphysical health. \n (ii) inculcate friendship between classmates, indulge \nin amicable behavior with others in school so that \nstudents develop a helpful nature. These are necessary \nfor mental and emotional health. \nChap-12.indd   209 8/24/2020   11:46:40 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n210",

This makes children \nacquire ability to live harmoniously in the society.\nRole of technology in building social health\nTechnology has made communication convenient through \nMobiles, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and E-mail \nmessages. Knowledge about different media can help to \ndevelop the skills to access the appropriate media for \naccurate information on a specific topic or issues. More \nso, because media brings awareness, and provides access \nto global knowledge and learning. But refrain from using \nmobiles and viewing the T.V. for long periods as that tends \nto be counter-productive and reduce interaction time with \nothers. This makes us socially withdrawn. Although media is \na source of information, all of it may not be true or reliable. \nIt is advisable to seek guidenes from a trusted adult while \naccessing media and internet. Moreover, there is a need to \nunderstand about real and fake news or information as these \naffects our attitude and behavior.\nRole of students in building habits of social health\nSocial health comes from social skills. A few important \nguidelines for promoting social skills are outlined below.\n (i) Building self awareness is an important skill: Practice \nself-care by developing habits of cleanliness and \nhygiene, keeping away from substance abuse, \nengaging in physical activity and regularly consuming \na balanced diet.\n (ii) Do not be blameful and judgmental: Remember when \nyou point a finger at others, three fingers of yours \npoint towards you. Hence indulge in knowing yourself \nbetter. It helps to discriminate between a good \nand a bad act of yours and helps to make friends. \nEmpathy and self awareness go hand in hand.  \nWhen you seea child hitting an animal, tell that \nChap-12.indd   210 8/24/2020   11:46:40 AM\n2024-25",

That is empathy for others and leads to self  \nawareness.\n (iii) Learn to identify your own mistakes: There is no harm \nin saying sorry for a mistake and rectifying it. People \nwill have faith in you if you did so.\n (iv) Make an effort to reconnect with old relationships and \nfriendships: The socially healthy person makes an \neffort to contact and meet old friends, to remember \nenjoyable periods of childhood which can be a good \nway to beat stress and spend leisure time. \n (v) Appreciate yourself and others: But never let your ego \nrule your behaviour which can sometimes drive you \nto lose a relationship.\n (vi) Try and be respectful, positive and supportive towards \nthe needy, the physically and mentally challenged, the \ndowntrodden and those belonging to faith and cultures \nother than yours. Lend an ear to others opinion. It \nteaches tolerance. Tolerance and appreciation are \nvirtues in socially healthy individuals. \nRole of family in inculcating social skills in young \nfamily members\nThe importance of family in inculcating social skills among, \nchildren is paramount. Guardians or parents are the prime \nteachers and caretakers who feed them healthy food and are \nalso their play mates. They have to be aware themselves to \nbe role model and make children appreciate as they grow.  \nThe benefits of enjoying nutritious food and being aware \nof a balanced diet is of paramount importance. Watching \nof television for longer duration is bad for students. \nParents themselves have to be cautious in what they do \nin front of children and how long they are in front of the \nTV. However, at the same time good TV programmes are \nan avenue for learning. Encourage them to indulge in \nphysical activity to build their muscles and bones. Fit body \nand fitness depends primarily on proper diet and healthy \nbody and mind. The parents and elder family members \nneed to guide them in social skills. Parents and elders \nhave to be accessible to children for necessary guidance.  \nThey  form a “safety network’. They are to guide adolescents \nthrough advice, answer their queries and occupy them \nthrough activities to keep them away from involvement \nin addictive substances like tobacco, drugs and alcohol \nwhich they might believe are helpful in tiding over stress. \nHowever, these substances have deleterious effects on the  \ngrowing body.\nChap-12.indd   211 8/24/2020   11:46:40 AM\n2024-25",

The \nNational Curriculum Framework (NCF-2005) prepared \nby NCERT considers health and physical education a \ncompulsory subject from Class I to X and optional \nsubject at Classes XI and XII. As a follow up of NCF-\n2005, NCERT has prepared syllabus on health and \nphysical education which has been approved by the \nNational Steering Committee set by the Government \nof India.

Government of \nIndia decided to set up a Joint Board in 1929 and it was \nnamed as the ‘Board of High School and Intermediate \nEducation. Later in 1952, the constitution of the Board was \namended and it was named as ‘Central Board of Secondary \nEducation’. In 1962 the Board was reconstituted once again \nwith the objectives: (i) to serve the educational institutions \nChap-13.indd   216 8/24/2020   12:27:35 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nAgencies And AwArd Promoting HeAltH, sPorts And YogA\n217\nmore effectively (ii) to be responsive to the educational \nneeds of those students whose parents were employed in \nthe Central Government and had frequently transferable \njobs. The major functions of the CBSE have been to develop \ncurriculum for all the subjects at the secondary and higher \nsecondary levels, to conduct evaluation and examination \nactivities, to organise teacher training workshops, to develop \nresource materials for teachers and students, to publish \nsome text books for secondary and senior secondary classes \nand to monitor various academic projects.

There is a State Council of Educational Research \nand Training (SCERT) in almost all the major States. This \ninstitution is responsible for preparation of syllabi and \ntextbooks for all the classes at primary and upper primary \nstages. In some of the States and Union Territories, the State \nInstitutes of Education (SIE) or the Directorates of Education \nperform these roles. All these institutions at the state level \nperform these roles for the subject area of Health and Physical \nEducation also. Then there are State Boards of Education, \nthat are responsible for preparation of Syllabi and textbooks \nand evaluation of students of all classes at secondary and \nhigher secondary stages. These institutions also conduct \nin-service teacher training for all the subjects including the \nsubject of Health and Physical Education.

A jump \nball is when a referee throws the ball up at center circle to \ndetermine which team gets possession. Two players from \nopposing teams jump up to tap the ball out of the circle in \norder to gain control over the ball take the game forward.

Here are examples of the three basic categories of \nteam defences. In addition, each category comprises of an \nassortment of different variations.\n • Man to man defence: Man-to-man defences match \nup the defenders against specific offensive players. \nDefenders are usually assigned to be matched up with \noffensive players by size and ability.\n • Zone Defence: In Zone defence, defenders are assigned \nto guard specific areas on the court. Zones are named \nor designated by their player alignments.\n • Combined Defence: A third type of defence that can be \ndeployed is the combination defence. With combina-\ntion defences, some of the players are assigned to play \nman-to-man while the rest of the defenders play zone. \nCombination defences are usually deployed in an effort \nto stop or neutralise great individual offensive players. \nRebounding\nThe objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession \nof the basketball after a missed field point or free throw, as it \nrebounds from the ring or backboard. This plays a major role \nin the game, as most possessions end when a team misses \na shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive \nrebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side \nand does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, \nin which the defending team gains possession of the loose \nball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team \non defence tends to be in better position to recover missed \nshots.\nChap-6.indd   82 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n83\nFig. 6.7: Rebounding\nArjun awardees\nS.No. Name of Player Year"

One \nteam bats, trying to defend the wicket and scoring as many \nruns as possible. The other team bowls and fields, trying to \ndismiss the batsmen and thus limiting the runs scored by \nthe batting team. A run is scored by the striking batsman \nhitting the ball with his bat, running to the opposite end \nof the pitch and touching the crease there without being \ndismissed. The teams switch between batting and fielding at \nthe end of an inning.\nChap-6.indd   83 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n84\nHistory\nThe game of cricket, as it is played today, has its origin in the \nsouth eastern part of England. Cricket became a generally \nadopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century. \nThe Hambeldon club which was founded in about 1750’s \nhad played a significant part in the evolution of the game. \nIt was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C) \nwith its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became \nan international game with the formation of the Imperial \nCricket Conference (I.C.C) in 1909. The name of Imperial \nCricket Conference was changed to International Cricket \nConference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the \ncommon wealth to become its members. The first Limited \nOver International cricket match was played in 1971 at \nMelbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) \nsaw its potential and staged the first limited over Cricket \nWorld Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket \nworld cup won by West Indies. \nIn the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20, \nhas made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international \nmatch took place on August 5 2004, between the women’s \nteams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20 \ninternational match between men’s teams was played on \nFebruary 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The \nfirst T-20 World Cup was played in South Africa in 2007. \nIndia won the first edition of T-20 World Cup.\nAn all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under \nMaharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Indian Cricket \nControl Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The \nnational championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935. \nIndia entered the international arena and played its first official \nTest against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji \nof Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies, \nmade a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket. \nMeasurement\nMin 122cm\nMin3.66 m2.64 m 3.05 m\nReturn Crease\nStumps\nBowling Crease\nPopping Crease\n20.12 m (22 yds)\nFig. 6.8: Specifications of cricket ground\nChap-6.indd   84 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n85\nWays to score runs\nThe aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main \ncricket rules for batsmen to score runs is that they must \nrun to the pitch at each other’s end (from one end to the \nother), hence score one run. Cricket rules state that, they \nmay run multiple runs per shot. As well as while running \nthey can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A batsman \nhits a boundary and scores 4 or 6 runs. A four and six both \nare scored by hitting the ball. If it crosses the boundary \nafter touching the ground it is considered as four and if \nthe ball crosses boundary before touching the ground it is \nconsidered as six. Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 \nhas been scored any runs physically scored by the batsman \nby running between the wickets are null and void. \nOther ways runs can be scored according to the cricket \nrules include no balls, wide balls, byes and leg byes. Cricket \nrules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded \nto the batting team but not the individual batters.\n • A No Ball can be declared for many reasons: If the \nheel of the bowler’s front foot lands on or in front of \nthe popping crease or if the bowler’s back foot touches \nthen outside the return crease the ball is declared no \nball. If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, \nthe ball is declared dangerous (often happens when \nbowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces \nmore than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman \nor if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The \nbatsman can hit a No ball and score runs off it but \ncannot be out from a No ball except if they are run \nout, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the \nfield. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no \nball for his shot while the team also gains one run for \nthe no ball itself.\n • A Wide Ball will be declared if the umpire thinks the \nbatsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to \nscore off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled \nover the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide \nbut a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide \ndeliveries in the shorter format of the game while being \nmuch more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will \nadd one run to the batting team and any runs scored \nby the batsman. The batsman is not supposed to be \ndeclared ‘out’ off a wide delivery except if they are \nstumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or \nobstruct the field.\n • A Bye is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes \nthe striking batsman and runs are scored without the \nbatsman hitting the ball.\nChap-6.indd   85 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n86\n • A Leg Bye  is where runs are scored by hitting the \nbatsman, but not the bat and the ball is not a no ball \nor wide. However no runs can be scored if the striking \nbatsman didn’t attempt to play a shot or if he was \navoiding the ball.\nTypes of ‘out’ in cricket\nWays batsmen can be given ‘Out’ according to cricket rules:\nThere are a number of different ways a batsman can be given \nout in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman \nout it is said that the bowler gets a ‘wicket’. Following are the \ndifferent ways, a batsman can be given out according to the \nrules of cricket:\nFig. 6.9: Bowled\n • Bowled – Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled \nand hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is \ngiven out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the \nball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched \nthe batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of \nthe batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have \ntouched another player or umpire before hitting the \nwickets.\n • Caught – Cricket rules state that if a batsman while \nplaying the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove \nholding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. \nThis is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler \ncatching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this \nis done then cricket rules state the batsman is out.\n • Leg before Wicket (LBW) – If the ball is bowled and \nhits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then \nan LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to \ngive this out he must first look at some of the factors \nstated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire \nChap-6.indd   86 8/24/2020   11:39:28 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n87\nneed to decide is that if is not a no ball, would the ball \nhave hit the wickets if the batsman was not there. If his, \nanswer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on \nthe leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman \nout. However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the \nline of off stump while he was attempting to play a \nstroke then he is not out.\n • Stumped – A batsman can be given out according to \ncricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his \nwicket while, he is out of his crease and not attempting \na run (if he is attempting a run it would be a run out).\n • Retired Out – A batsman leaves the field without the \npermission of umpire for any resource like, illness, \ninjury etc. Than is given as retired out. \n • Run Out – Cricket rules state that a batsman is out \nif no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the \npopping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket \nis fairly put down by the fielding side.\n • Hit Wicket – Cricket rules specify that if a batsman \nhits his wicket down with his bat or body after the \nbowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in \nplay then he is out. \n • Handled the Ball – Cricket rules allow the batsman \nto be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the \nhand that is not touching the bat without the consent \nof the opposition or umpire.\n • Timed Out – An incoming batsman must be ready to \nface a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner \nwithin three minutes of the outgoing batsman being \ndismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman \ncan be given timed out.\n • Hit the Ball Twice – Cricket rules state that if a \nbatsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose \nof protecting his wicket or with consent from the \nopposition, he is out.\n • Obstructing the Field – A batsman is out if he \nintentionally obstructs the opposition by word or action\nThere are many other cricket rules. However these are \nmost of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing \nthe game. Many of the more advanced rules and laws can be \nlearned along the way and are not vital to general play.\nIf any batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire’s \nconsent for any reason other than injury or incapacity, \nhe may resume the innings only with the consent of the \nopposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out. \nFor the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out \nis considered a dismissal.\nChap-6.indd   87 8/24/2020   11:39:28 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n88\nRules\n • Cricket is a game played between two teams consisting \nof eleven players each. There is also a reserve player \ncalled a twelfth man, who can only be utilized as fielder.\n • The twelfth man is not allowed to ball, bat, and wicket \nkeeping or captain the team. His sole duty is to act as \na substitute fielder.\n • Two umpires are placed on the playing field while there \nis also a third umpire off the field who is in charge of \nvideo decisions.\n • When the call is too close for the on field umpires \nthen they refer it to the third umpire who reviews slow \nmotion video replays to make a decision.\nFundamental skills\nBatting skills\nBeing a batsman he must have good wrist power, eye co-\nordination, Endurance, speed, Excellent reaction ability and \nStatistics for cricket.\nFig. 6.10: Batting skill\nChap-6.indd   88 8/24/2020   11:39:30 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n89\nBatting techniques\n•\t Defence •\t Drive\n•\t Pull •\t Cut\n•\t Hook •\t Sweep\nFront foot defence\n • The front foot defence is played when the ball is bowled \nat a good length, which is not over-pitched enough for \na drive and not short enough to go on the back foot. \n • The front foot should move as close as possible to \nthe pitch of the ball with the left shoulder and left \nelbow leading the body in the direction of the ball.\n • The weight of the body is on the front foot with \nthe knee bent and the head should be over the bat \nwatching the point of contact. The bat is kept angled \nand very close to the front pad to prevent the ball \ngoing through bat and pad. \n • The top hand is firm at the top of the handle while the \nbottom hand is relaxed, with the thumb and index \nfinger loosely holding the bat. The back leg should \nbe fully extended with the heel raised off the ground \nbut remaining parallel to the crease.\n • The weight of the back foot should be on the inside \nof the right toe and care should be taken not to turn \nit or drag it out of the crease. \n • The front foot defensive stroke can be played with \nthe bat slightly behind or in front of the pad depend-\ning on the nature of the wicket and the proficiency \nof the bowler. \nOff drive\n • Off drive is played to an over-pitched ball in line with \nthe off stump or marginally outside. \n • Like the forward defence, the left shoulder and elbow \nlead the body with the front foot going as close as \npossible to the pitch of the ball. The bat comes down \nin and arc from the top of the back lift and strikes the \nball just in front of the left foot. \n • After impact, the bat must continue in the arc and finish \nover the left shoulder. The follow through can also be \nchecked at shoulder height, keeping the bat face open. \n • The head is kept straight and still throughout the shot \nand the top hand and elbow controls the direction of \nthe shot. At the time of impact the head should be \nover the ball with the body weight balanced on the \nfront foot. The full face of the bat must hit the ball and \non \ncompletion, the batsman must be well balanced. \nChap-6.indd   89 8/24/2020   11:39:30 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n90\nStraight drive\n • This shot is played exactly in the same way as an off \ndrive but with the difference is that it is played to a over \npitched ball in and around the line of middle stump \nand the front foot must point down the wicket and the \nbody must be turned slightly and the shoulders opened \nout to allow the free swing of the bat. \nOn drive\n • On drive is played to a over-pitched ball on and around \nthe leg stump. \n • This has been considered to be a difficult shot to play. \nThe basic principles of a drive apply here too, though \nthe swing of the bat is an arc from slips to mid- on \nwith the front pointing down the wicket. \n • The front foot should be placed outside the line of ball \nwith the shoulders turned and the impact is just in \nfront of the left toe. The follow through is generally \nchecked below shoulder height.\nBack foot defence\n • The back foot defensive stroke is played to a short-\npitched ball in line with the stumps, which is not \nshort enough to play and attacking shot.\n • The back foot is moved back and across to the line \nof the ball with the front naturally following it. The \nbat is brought down close to the body with the head \nsteady and over the ball. \n • The back foot must remain parallel to the crease as \nfar as possible to maintain the sideways position of \nthe body with the top hand firm and in control, and \nthe bottom hand holding the bat loosely.\n • To keep the bat straight, the left elbow is held high \nnext to the head. Care should be taken to maintain \nthe balance at the time of playing the ball and to \nremain ‘side-on’ as this presents a smaller target for \nshort rising deliveries. \n • The back foot defence can also be played with the \nbody beside the line of the ball, but here the batsman \nmust resist the temptation to follow the movement of \nthe ball away from him. \nBowling skills\nBowling is as important as batting. The ball is defended by \na batsman to save his wicket. When the ball is bowled to a \nbatsman it is called as a ball or delivery.\nFig. 6.11: Bowling Skills\nChap-6.indd   90 8/24/2020   11:39:31 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n91\nTypes of bowling\nFast bowling Spin bowling\nSeam bowling Off spin\nSwing bowling Leg spin\nBouncer Chinaman\nIn swinger Doosra \nLeg cutter Googly\nOff cutter Arm ball\nSwing bowling\n • When a ball of a fast or medium fast bowler deviator in \nair either on leg side (in swing) or on off side (out swing) \nit is turned in air as swing bowling.\nOutswing\n • For out swing bowling, the ball is held with the index \nand middle finger and thumb below the seam, which \nis upright & angled towards the slips with the shiny \nsurface on the right (for right hand bowler).\n • For effective out swing bowling, the bowler should bowl \nas close as possible to the stumps.\n • The wrist is cocked and when the ball is released the \nseam must be vertical and goes down the pitch upright. \nThe two fingers should stay behind the seam as long as \npossible. \nInswing\n • Here, the ball is held by the two fingers and the thumb \nunderneath it, with the seam upright and angle towards \nfine leg. \n • The shiny side is on the left side and the fingers may \nalso have a slight gap between them.\nWicket keeping\nThe wicket keeper plays an important role in cricket. \nA good wicket keeper can save a number of runs for his team.  \nHis function is to stop deliveries, which the batsman is \nunable to play or passed by batsman.\nFielding\nIn 21st century, fielding is a key point to win the match.  \nA player requires more hard work, practice and flexibility to \nbecome a good fielder.\nFig. 6.12: Wicket keeping\nChap-6.indd   91 8/24/2020   11:39:32 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 16 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n92\n3rd Man\nLeg Slips\nFine leg\nSlips\nGully\nPoint\nCover Point\nCover\nExtra Cover\nMid off Mid on\nMid Wicket\nSquare Leg\nBowler\nWK\nDeep\nSquare\nDeep\nMid Wicket\nDeep Extra\nCover\nLong off Long on\nFig. 6.13: Fielding\nArjuna awardee\nS.No. Name of Player Year\n1 Sachin Tendulkar 1994\n2 Sourav Ganguly 1997\n3 Rahul Dravid 1998\n4 Mithali Raj 2003\n5 Anju Jain 2005\n6 Anjum Chopra 2006\n7 Jhulan Goswami 2010\nChap-6.indd   92 8/24/2020   11:39:32 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n93\n8 Virat Kohli 2013\n9 Harmanpreet Kaur 2017\n10 Smriti Mandhana 2018\nBharat Ratna\nS.No. Name of Player Year"

        "content": "FootBall \nFootball has been a very popular game all over the world \nsince ages. Also commonly known as soccer, it is a game \nthat involves kicking a ball with the foot to score a point. \nIt is played between two teams with a spherical ball on a \nrectangular field of grass or green artificial turf. There is a \ngoal post at each end of the rectangular field and errected \nat the middle of base line. Points are scored by moving the \nball to an opposing team’s end of the field and putting it \nbetween two goal posts. Players are required to move the ball \nby kicking, dribbling, carrying, and passing. The team that \nscores more points than the other by the end of the match \nwins the game.\nHistory\nAccording to FIFA (Federation International de Football \nAssociation), the “very earliest form of the game was played \nin china during the second and third centuries. The game \nwas later developed in England and the rules of football were \nformulated in India, football began its journey when the \nBritish rulers brought it with them and in no time it became \npopular in the masses. The first recorded game here took place \nbetween the ‘Calcutta Club of Civilians’ and the ‘Gentlemen \nof Barrackpore’ in 1854. The first ever football club in India, \nthe ‘Calcutta Football Club’ was founded in 1872. The first \nfootball association, “the Indian Football Association” (IFA) \nwas established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no \nIndian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India \nFootball Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is \nthe oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was \nstarted in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is \nknown as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as \nthe country put up commendable performances in a number \nof international competitions. India won gold medals in 1951 \nand 1962 Asian Games, held at New Delhi and Jakarta.\n68-70 cm\nCircumference\nof football\nFig. 6.14: Specifications of \nfootball\nChap-6.indd   93 8/24/2020   11:39:32 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n94\nFig. 6.15: Children playing football\n90-120m\nHalfway Line\nCentre Circle\nCentre Spot\nRadius\n9.15m\nPenalty Area\nPenalty\nSpotGoal Area\nGoal45-90m Goal Line\nRadius9.15m\n40.3m\n16.5m\n11m\n5.5m\n16.5m\n7.32m\n2.45m\n10 yds\nFig. 6.16: Specifications of football ground\nField measurements\nAs per international standard, the length of the rectangular \nfootball field (pitch) is in the range of 100 to 110 m (110 to \n120 yards) and the width is in the range of 65 to 75 m (70 \nto 80 yards). There are also goal posts at the back of each \nfootball zone. One way to score is to kick the football through \nthe goal posts. The ball must go between the uprights and \nover the crossbar. \nChap-6.indd   94 8/24/2020   11:39:34 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n95\nGoal post\nDistance between the posts is 7.32 meter whereas the height \nof the goal post is 2.44 meter.\nRules\nAccording to the official rules of football guide, the players \nneed to execute the game in a fair and accepted manner. The \nfootball match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each. \nThere are several rules in the game of football regarding the \nfield, players, penalties, offence and defence. \nStart and restart of play\nA coin toss takes place before the game starts, the winner of \nthe toss will get the choice of choosing the end to attack. At \nthe kick-off, all players from each side must be in their own \nhalves of the field. The kick-off takes place on the centre spot \nin the centre circle. The player who kicks off cannot touch it \nagain until another player has made contact.\nPunishment for offences\nIf the player persistently offends during a match, the referee \ncan choose to take action. First the Yellow Card as a caution \nis shown to a player. Any offence after the second one leads \nto Red card. If they showed a red card to a player it means \nthat player is expelled from the match. A straight red card (no \nprevious caution) can be shown for extreme offences, such \nas, serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, deliberately \nhandling the ball to prevent a goal, a professional foul (denying \na goal scoring opportunity) and insulting language and/or \ngestures.\nFree kicks\nWhenever a free kick is taken, the players on the opposite \nside must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it \nis kicked. If this rule is not adhered to, the kick is retaken. \nThere are two types of free kicks awarded, depending on the \nnature of the offence: (i) Direct Free Kick — allows the team \nto take a direct shot at the opponent`s goal. (ii) Indirect Free \nKick — a direct strike on goal is not permitted. It means a \nsecond player has to touch the ball after the kick is taken to \nscore a goal.\nPenalty kick\nA penalty kick is awarded for offences taking place in the \npenalty and goal areas. A nominated member of the team is \nallowed to strike at goal from the penalty spot, with only the \ngoalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper must remain on his line \nuntil the ball has been kicked, and all other players must be \noutside the penalty area behind the penalty spot. After the \nChap-6.indd   95 8/24/2020   11:39:34 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 20 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n96\nplayer has taken the kick, that player cannot strike the ball \nagain without another player touching the ball.\nThrow-in\nA throw-in is awarded when the whole ball crosses the touch \nline (conceded by the team who last touched the ball). It \nis delivered on the field of play with both hands and from \nbehind and over the player’s head. Otherwise it is deemed to \nbe a foul throw and a throw-in is given to the opposition. It \ncannot go directly to the goalkeeper’s hands (if on the same \nteam). A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.\nCorner kick\nA corner kick is awarded once the whole ball crosses the goal \nline of the opposition, after touching one of their players. \nA kick is taken from the corner of whichever side the ball \ntravelled over the field. Opponents must be 10 yards from \nthe corner arc and the kicker cannot touch the ball a second \ntime without having touched by any other player.\nFundamental skills\nReceiving\nReceiving a ball on the ground is different than receiving a \nball in air. Keep your eye on the ball, select the foot to receive \nthe ball, don’t stop the ball, prepare it for new action or move, \nshot, dribble, pass.\nPassing\nPassing involves giving the ball to partners. Perfect decision \nmaking is required before a perfect pass. Before pass,  \nsee the target, approach the ball, and look at the ball holding \nthe head steady. Strike the correct area of the ball with \nlacked ankle, make sure of follow through and transfer of \nweight forward.\nShooting\nShooting uses the same elements as used in passing, the \ndifference is that the ball is to be passed to the goal keeper to \nconvert the score for the team. Player should look up to see \nthe position of goal keeper, choosing the area to shoot the \nball while make a proper contact with the ball with proper \nfollow through.\nTrapping\nIt is a method of gaining control of the ball. Trapping uses \nthe feet, thigh, or chest to bring the ball to the ground.\nChap-6.indd   96 8/24/2020   11:39:34 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 21 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n97\nTechniques and lead-up activities\nThe students already learnt the fundamental techniques of \nplaying football in the previous classes. Now let us discuss a \nfew lead-up activities to develop these techniques.\nBall control\nFive versus two in 30m x 20m area. Players make two touches \nonly to retain possession of the ball. \nDribbling\nFour quarters of the area are numbered. One player dribbles \nin one quarter and passes the ball to quarter number 2 \nand so on. Reaching last quarter, the player without losing \nthe ball gets points. If ball is lost in any quarter, the other \nteams start anti clockwise and then enter in to the next three \nquarters. \nPassing\nNumber of players—four. Rectangle measures 5m × 20m or \n10m × 30 m, one ball.\nHeading\nTwo versus two, Goal of 8 yards, Centre line 5 yards from \neach goal.\nShooting\nShooting board is a place along the penalty spot, arranged \ninside the penalty area. \nTackling\nOne versus one, 10m × 10m area, time 2 minutes. \nThrow-ins\nThrow-in is a competition between two players.\nGoal keeper\nA goal keeper also acts as a defence but is allowed to catch \nor touch the ball with hands within the penalty box (D-area). \nA goal keeper is usually the last man standing at the goal to \nprevent opponents from scoring the goal. \nArjuna awardees\nS.No. Name of Player Year\n1 P.K.

However, the name Field Hockey is used in countries \nin which the word Hockey is generally reserved for another \nform of hockey, such as ice hockey or street hockey. \nThe players should learn and practice the basic skills of \ndribbling, passing, tapping and hitting. They should learn \nhow to attack and score goals and how to work with others \nto defend and stop goals from being scored. To do this they \nneed to learn how to keep possession by dribbling effectively \nand moving the ball accurately and quickly between players. \nAs they progress, skills should become more consistent and \nefficient, and the players should be introduced to set play \nsituations. \nFig. 6.17: Players playing hockey\nHistory\nThe history of the game of hockey has its roots well laid in the \nworld’s early civilisations. One of the oldest known sports, the \nhockey game is believed to be in existence about 1200 years \nbefore the Ancient Games of Olympia. Right from Arabs, \nGreeks, Romans, and Persians to Ethiopians, every country \nplayed with a variation of the game. While some played it just \nChap-6.indd   98 8/24/2020   11:39:36 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 23 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n99\nfor recreation, the others had the opinion that hockey would \nmake them better warriors. Even though many ancient \ncivilisations played hockey in different variations, the modern \ngame of field hockey was developed in the British Isles in the \n19th century. It was introduced in India by the British Army \nregiments and the game soon became popular. It was during \nthis time that the London Hockey Association was formed \nand the rules for playing hockey were standardised. In 1924, \nthe International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded and \nthree years later, the International Federation of Women’s \nHockey followed.\nIn India, the first hockey club came up in Calcutta in \n1885-86 and soon Bombay and Punjab followed. Making \nits Olympic debut at the 1928 Amsterdam Games, Indian \nhockey team won its first Olympic gold, without conceding \na single goal. The hallmark of this ruthless domination was \nthe wizardry of Indian hockey legend, Dhyan Chand, who \nmesmerised the Amsterdam crowd with his dazzling skills. \nFrom 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold \nmedals, while winning 24 consecutive matches. It was the \ngolden era of Indian hockey, when India produced some of \nthe finest players the game has ever seen.\nField measurements\n91.40 m\n55 m\n22.9 m\nCentre line\n22.9 m\nPenalty Spot\n22.9 m\n14.63 m\n6.4 m\n5.5 m\n5 m\nFig. 6.18: Specification of hockey field\nChap-6.indd   99 8/24/2020   11:39:36 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 24 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n100\nHockey is played on a 91.40 m × 55 m rectangular field.  \nAt each end there is a goal 2.14 m high 1.20 m deep and \n3.66 m wide measured from the inner sides of the posts and \ncrossbar, and the goal post is surrounded by an approximately \nsemi-circular area 14.63 m from the goal bounded by \na solid line. A spot 0.15m in diameter, called the penalty  \nspot, is marked with its centre 6.40 m from the centre of \neach goal.\nEquipment\nEach player carries a stick, normally a little over 3 feet (90 \ncentimeters) long, 2 inches wide and traditionally made \nof wood but now often made with fiberglass, Kevlar and \ncarbon fiber composites, with a rounded handle flattening \nout on one side and with a hook at the bottom.\nRules\nThe rules set by the International Hockey Federation FIH \nare used worldwide.\nGeneral play\nPrior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the \nwinning captain can choose a starting end or start with \nthe ball. The game time is divided into four quarters of 15 \nminutes each 15-02-15-10-15-2-15. At the start of each \nquarter as well as after goals are scored, play is started \nwith a pass from the centre of the field.\nField players may only play the ball with the flat side \nof the stick. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler \ndoes not make contact with the attacker or his stick \nbefore playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also \nbe penalised if the tackle was made from a position where \ncontact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball \nmay not deliberately use his body or stick to shield the \nball from a legitimate tackle.\nWhen the ball passes over the sidelines, it is returned to \nplay from sideline either by individual player by himself or \nwith a push or hit, taken by a member of the team whose \nplayers were not the last to touch the ball before crossing \nthe sideline. If it crosses the goal line after last touched \nby an attacker, a 15 mt hit or pass can be made by any \nplayer of the defending team. A 15 mt hit is also awarded \nfor offenses committed by the attacking side within  \n15 mt of the end, of the pitch they are attacking. \nFree hits\nFree hits are awarded when offences are committed outside \nthe scoring circles. The ball may be hit or pushed once in \nany direction by the team offended against.

Corners are played by \nthe attacking team and involve a free hit from the 22.90  \nmeter line.\nPenalty corner\nThe penalty corner is set play that is awarded against \na defending team when any offence is committed in the \ndefensive circle, and may be awarded when a deliberate \noffence is committed in the defending 23 m area, or when the \ndefending team deliberately plays the ball over the back line. \nPenalty stroke\nA penalty stroke is awarded when defenders commit a \ndeliberate foul in the circle which deprives an attacker of \npossession or the opportunity to play the ball. This penalty \nis being taken by a single attacker against the goalkeeper, \nand is taken from a spot 6.4 m from the penalty spot and \ndirectly in front of the goal. The goalkeeper must stand with \nheels on the goal line, and cannot move his feet until the ball \nis played. \nOn the umpire’s whistle, the striker may push or flick the \nball at the goal, which the goalkeeper attempts to save. The \nplayer taking the penalty shot may not touch the ball twice. \nHitting or dragging or tapping the ball is also forbidden. If \nthe shot is saved, play is restarted with 15 mt hit to the \ndefenders; if a goal is scored, play is restarted from the centre \nline. Time is stopped for the Penalty stroke.\nDangerous play\nIf the ball is raised off the ground in a manner that is, in the \numpire’s opinion, dangerous, the ball is turned over to the \nother team and they receive a free hit from the point of contact. \nTie breaker (shootout)\nIn case of a draw match, penalty shootout is conducted. \nThe winners will be decided by 5 penalty shootouts by each \nteam and the team which scores highest number of goals \nis declared the winner. The shootout will start at 22.90 mt. \nline in front of the shooter and should be completed within 8 \nseconds after the umpire’s whistle.

Therefore,  \ngood anticipation and movement skills should be taught \nto players. At competency level, students should learn and \npractice the basic skills of sending and receiving the ball over \na high net. They should play simple 3 touch volleyball games \nworking as a team to keep the ball in play and ground it on \nthe opponent’s side of the court.\nHistory\nOriginally named Mintonette, it was created as a gentle indoor \nsport for older players to be able to exert a bit of athletic \neffort by keeping the ball in the air. The idea of using a net \nwas borrowed from tennis. It was raised to a height above \nthe average man’s height. During a demonstration game, \nsomeone remarked that the players seemed to be volleying \nthe ball back and forth over the net, and perhaps “volleyball” \nwould be a more descriptive name for the sport. The game \nof Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in the year \n1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts by YMCA (USA). It was \ninvented as a recreational game. This game was brought to \nIndia more than 85 years ago when some physical education \nChap-6.indd   102 8/24/2020   11:39:36 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 27 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n103\nteachers had been abroad and were trained in different  \ngames including Volleyball. YMCA College of Physical \nEducation, Madras, took this game seriously and students \ntrained there have taken the game to other parts of  \nthe country.\nFig. 6.19: Players playing volleyball\nMeasurements\nSide Line\nEndline Endline\n9m\n3-8m\n9m\nService Zone\nBack Zone\nFront\nZone\nFront\nZone\nBack Zone\nAttack line\nCentrelineand net\nAttack line\n3m 3m 3-8m\n9m\nService Zone\n9m\nA Antenna\nFig. 6.20: Specifications of volleyball court\nChap-6.indd   103 8/24/2020   11:39:38 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 28 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n104\nNETR Posts\nThe net is 2.43 mt high for men and 2.24 mt high for women. \nIt is doubled vertically over the center line.

The top on antenna extends \n80 cm above the net. The 2.55 m high posts are placed  \n0.5 m – 1.0 m out side the side line.\nRules\nVolleyball is a fast game played by two teams of 6 players \neach. It can be played indoors or outdoors. A player \non one of the teams begins a ‘rally’ by serving the ball \nfrom behind the back line of the court, over the net, \nand into the receiving team’s court. The receiving team \nmust not let the ball be grounded within their court. \nThe rally continues, with each team allowed up to three \nconsecutive touches, until either a team grounds the ball \non the opponent’s court and wins the rally or a team \ncommits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins \nthe rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball to start \nthe next rally. The ball is usually played with the hands \nor arms, but players can legally strike or push the ball \nwith any part of the body.\nCommon faults include —\n • catching and throwing the ball; \n • two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the "

Here are examples of the three basic categories of \nteam defences. In addition, each category comprises of an \nassortment of different variations.\n • Man to man defence: Man-to-man defences match \nup the defenders against specific offensive players. \nDefenders are usually assigned to be matched up with \noffensive players by size and ability.\n • Zone Defence: In Zone defence, defenders are assigned \nto guard specific areas on the court. Zones are named \nor designated by their player alignments.\n • Combined Defence: A third type of defence that can be \ndeployed is the combination defence. With combina-\ntion defences, some of the players are assigned to play \nman-to-man while the rest of the defenders play zone. \nCombination defences are usually deployed in an effort \nto stop or neutralise great individual offensive players. \nRebounding\nThe objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession \nof the basketball after a missed field point or free throw, as it \nrebounds from the ring or backboard. This plays a major role \nin the game, as most possessions end when a team misses \na shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive \nrebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side \nand does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, \nin which the defending team gains possession of the loose \nball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team \non defence tends to be in better position to recover missed \nshots.\nChap-6.indd   82 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n83\nFig. 6.7: Rebounding\nArjun awardees\nS.No. Name of Player Year",

One \nteam bats, trying to defend the wicket and scoring as many \nruns as possible. The other team bowls and fields, trying to \ndismiss the batsmen and thus limiting the runs scored by \nthe batting team. A run is scored by the striking batsman \nhitting the ball with his bat, running to the opposite end \nof the pitch and touching the crease there without being \ndismissed. The teams switch between batting and fielding at \nthe end of an inning.\nChap-6.indd   83 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n84\nHistory\nThe game of cricket, as it is played today, has its origin in the \nsouth eastern part of England. Cricket became a generally \nadopted sport in the second half of the seventeenth century. \nThe Hambeldon club which was founded in about 1750’s \nhad played a significant part in the evolution of the game. \nIt was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C) \nwith its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became \nan international game with the formation of the Imperial \nCricket Conference (I.C.C) in 1909. The name of Imperial \nCricket Conference was changed to International Cricket \nConference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the \ncommon wealth to become its members. The first Limited \nOver International cricket match was played in 1971 at \nMelbourne. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) \nsaw its potential and staged the first limited over Cricket \nWorld Cup in 1975. The first edition of limited over Cricket \nworld cup won by West Indies. \nIn the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty 20, \nhas made an immediate impact. The first T-20 international \nmatch took place on August 5 2004, between the women’s \nteams of England and New Zealand. The first T-20 \ninternational match between men’s teams was played on \nFebruary 17 2005, between Australia and New Zealand. The \nfirst T-20 World Cup was played in South Africa in 2007. \nIndia won the first edition of T-20 World Cup.\nAn all India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under \nMaharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Indian Cricket \nControl Board came into being towards the end of 1928. The \nnational championship for the Ranji Trophy began in 1935. \nIndia entered the international arena and played its first official \nTest against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singhji \nof Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies, \nmade a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket. \nMeasurement\nMin 122cm\nMin3.66 m2.64 m 3.05 m\nReturn Crease\nStumps\nBowling Crease\nPopping Crease\n20.12 m (22 yds)\nFig. 6.8: Specifications of cricket ground\nChap-6.indd   84 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25",

        "content": "--- Page 9 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n85\nWays to score runs\nThe aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main \ncricket rules for batsmen to score runs is that they must \nrun to the pitch at each other’s end (from one end to the \nother), hence score one run. Cricket rules state that, they \nmay run multiple runs per shot. As well as while running \nthey can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A batsman \nhits a boundary and scores 4 or 6 runs. A four and six both \nare scored by hitting the ball. If it crosses the boundary \nafter touching the ground it is considered as four and if \nthe ball crosses boundary before touching the ground it is \nconsidered as six. Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 \nhas been scored any runs physically scored by the batsman \nby running between the wickets are null and void. \nOther ways runs can be scored according to the cricket \nrules include no balls, wide balls, byes and leg byes. Cricket \nrules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded \nto the batting team but not the individual batters.\n • A No Ball can be declared for many reasons: If the \nheel of the bowler’s front foot lands on or in front of \nthe popping crease or if the bowler’s back foot touches \nthen outside the return crease the ball is declared no \nball. If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, \nthe ball is declared dangerous (often happens when \nbowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces \nmore than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman \nor if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The \nbatsman can hit a No ball and score runs off it but \ncannot be out from a No ball except if they are run \nout, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the \nfield. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no \nball for his shot while the team also gains one run for \nthe no ball itself.\n • A Wide Ball will be declared if the umpire thinks the \nbatsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to \nscore off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled \nover the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide \nbut a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide \ndeliveries in the shorter format of the game while being \nmuch more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will \nadd one run to the batting team and any runs scored \nby the batsman. The batsman is not supposed to be \ndeclared ‘out’ off a wide delivery except if they are \nstumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or \nobstruct the field.\n • A Bye is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes \nthe striking batsman and runs are scored without the \nbatsman hitting the ball.\nChap-6.indd   85 8/24/2020   11:39:26 AM\n2024-25",

However no runs can be scored if the striking \nbatsman didn’t attempt to play a shot or if he was \navoiding the ball.\nTypes of ‘out’ in cricket\nWays batsmen can be given ‘Out’ according to cricket rules:\nThere are a number of different ways a batsman can be given \nout in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman \nout it is said that the bowler gets a ‘wicket’. Following are the \ndifferent ways, a batsman can be given out according to the \nrules of cricket:\nFig. 6.9: Bowled\n • Bowled – Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled \nand hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is \ngiven out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the \nball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched \nthe batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of \nthe batsman. However, the ball is not allowed to have \ntouched another player or umpire before hitting the \nwickets.\n • Caught – Cricket rules state that if a batsman while \nplaying the ball, either it touches his bat, hand or glove \nholding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. \nThis is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler \ncatching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this \nis done then cricket rules state the batsman is out.\n • Leg before Wicket (LBW) – If the ball is bowled and \nhits the .batsman first without touching the bat, then \nan LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to \ngive this out he must first look at some of the factors \nstated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire \nChap-6.indd   86 8/24/2020   11:39:28 AM\n2024-25",

If his, \nanswer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on \nthe leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman \nout. However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the \nline of off stump while he was attempting to play a \nstroke then he is not out.\n • Stumped – A batsman can be given out according to \ncricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his \nwicket while, he is out of his crease and not attempting \na run (if he is attempting a run it would be a run out).\n • Retired Out – A batsman leaves the field without the \npermission of umpire for any resource like, illness, \ninjury etc. Than is given as retired out. \n • Run Out – Cricket rules state that a batsman is out \nif no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the \npopping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket \nis fairly put down by the fielding side.\n • Hit Wicket – Cricket rules specify that if a batsman \nhits his wicket down with his bat or body after the \nbowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in \nplay then he is out. \n • Handled the Ball – Cricket rules allow the batsman \nto be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the \nhand that is not touching the bat without the consent \nof the opposition or umpire.\n • Timed Out – An incoming batsman must be ready to \nface a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner \nwithin three minutes of the outgoing batsman being \ndismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman \ncan be given timed out.\n • Hit the Ball Twice – Cricket rules state that if a \nbatsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose \nof protecting his wicket or with consent from the \nopposition, he is out.\n • Obstructing the Field – A batsman is out if he \nintentionally obstructs the opposition by word or action\nThere are many other cricket rules. However these are \nmost of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing \nthe game. Many of the more advanced rules and laws can be \nlearned along the way and are not vital to general play.\nIf any batsman leaves the field of play without the Umpire’s \nconsent for any reason other than injury or incapacity, \nhe may resume the innings only with the consent of the \nopposing captain. If he fails to resume his innings, he is out. \nFor the purposes of calculating a batting average, retired out \nis considered a dismissal.\nChap-6.indd   87 8/24/2020   11:39:28 AM\n2024-25",

The bat is kept angled \nand very close to the front pad to prevent the ball \ngoing through bat and pad. \n • The top hand is firm at the top of the handle while the \nbottom hand is relaxed, with the thumb and index \nfinger loosely holding the bat. The back leg should \nbe fully extended with the heel raised off the ground \nbut remaining parallel to the crease.\n • The weight of the back foot should be on the inside \nof the right toe and care should be taken not to turn \nit or drag it out of the crease. \n • The front foot defensive stroke can be played with \nthe bat slightly behind or in front of the pad depend-\ning on the nature of the wicket and the proficiency \nof the bowler. \nOff drive\n • Off drive is played to an over-pitched ball in line with \nthe off stump or marginally outside. \n • Like the forward defence, the left shoulder and elbow \nlead the body with the front foot going as close as \npossible to the pitch of the ball. The bat comes down \nin and arc from the top of the back lift and strikes the \nball just in front of the left foot. \n • After impact, the bat must continue in the arc and finish \nover the left shoulder. The follow through can also be \nchecked at shoulder height, keeping the bat face open. \n • The head is kept straight and still throughout the shot \nand the top hand and elbow controls the direction of \nthe shot. At the time of impact the head should be \nover the ball with the body weight balanced on the \nfront foot. The full face of the bat must hit the ball and \non \ncompletion, the batsman must be well balanced. \nChap-6.indd   89 8/24/2020   11:39:30 AM\n2024-25",

The follow through is generally \nchecked below shoulder height.\nBack foot defence\n • The back foot defensive stroke is played to a short-\npitched ball in line with the stumps, which is not \nshort enough to play and attacking shot.\n • The back foot is moved back and across to the line \nof the ball with the front naturally following it. The \nbat is brought down close to the body with the head \nsteady and over the ball. \n • The back foot must remain parallel to the crease as \nfar as possible to maintain the sideways position of \nthe body with the top hand firm and in control, and \nthe bottom hand holding the bat loosely.\n • To keep the bat straight, the left elbow is held high \nnext to the head. Care should be taken to maintain \nthe balance at the time of playing the ball and to \nremain ‘side-on’ as this presents a smaller target for \nshort rising deliveries. \n • The back foot defence can also be played with the \nbody beside the line of the ball, but here the batsman \nmust resist the temptation to follow the movement of \nthe ball away from him. \nBowling skills\nBowling is as important as batting. The ball is defended by \na batsman to save his wicket. When the ball is bowled to a \nbatsman it is called as a ball or delivery.\nFig. 6.11: Bowling Skills\nChap-6.indd   90 8/24/2020   11:39:31 AM\n2024-25",

        "content": "FootBall \nFootball has been a very popular game all over the world \nsince ages. Also commonly known as soccer, it is a game \nthat involves kicking a ball with the foot to score a point. \nIt is played between two teams with a spherical ball on a \nrectangular field of grass or green artificial turf. There is a \ngoal post at each end of the rectangular field and errected \nat the middle of base line. Points are scored by moving the \nball to an opposing team’s end of the field and putting it \nbetween two goal posts. Players are required to move the ball \nby kicking, dribbling, carrying, and passing. The team that \nscores more points than the other by the end of the match \nwins the game.\nHistory\nAccording to FIFA (Federation International de Football \nAssociation), the “very earliest form of the game was played \nin china during the second and third centuries. The game \nwas later developed in England and the rules of football were \nformulated in India, football began its journey when the \nBritish rulers brought it with them and in no time it became \npopular in the masses. The first recorded game here took place \nbetween the ‘Calcutta Club of Civilians’ and the ‘Gentlemen \nof Barrackpore’ in 1854. The first ever football club in India, \nthe ‘Calcutta Football Club’ was founded in 1872. The first \nfootball association, “the Indian Football Association” (IFA) \nwas established in Calcutta in 1893, though there was no \nIndian on its board till 1930s. It was later, replaced by All India \nFootball Federation (AIFF). The Durand Cup Tournament is \nthe oldest in India and the one of the oldest in the world, was \nstarted in Shimla in 1888. The decade of 1951 to 1962 is \nknown as the golden era in the history of Indian football, as \nthe country put up commendable performances in a number \nof international competitions. India won gold medals in 1951 \nand 1962 Asian Games, held at New Delhi and Jakarta.\n68-70 cm\nCircumference\nof football\nFig. 6.14: Specifications of \nfootball\nChap-6.indd   93 8/24/2020   11:39:32 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n94\nFig. 6.15: Children playing football\n90-120m\nHalfway Line\nCentre Circle\nCentre Spot\nRadius\n9.15m\nPenalty Area\nPenalty\nSpotGoal Area\nGoal45-90m Goal Line\nRadius9.15m\n40.3m\n16.5m\n11m\n5.5m\n16.5m\n7.32m\n2.45m\n10 yds\nFig. 6.16: Specifications of football ground\nField measurements\nAs per international standard, the length of the rectangular \nfootball field (pitch) is in the range of 100 to 110 m (110 to \n120 yards) and the width is in the range of 65 to 75 m (70 \nto 80 yards).

The \nfootball match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each. \nThere are several rules in the game of football regarding the \nfield, players, penalties, offence and defence. \nStart and restart of play\nA coin toss takes place before the game starts, the winner of \nthe toss will get the choice of choosing the end to attack. At \nthe kick-off, all players from each side must be in their own \nhalves of the field. The kick-off takes place on the centre spot \nin the centre circle. The player who kicks off cannot touch it \nagain until another player has made contact.\nPunishment for offences\nIf the player persistently offends during a match, the referee \ncan choose to take action. First the Yellow Card as a caution \nis shown to a player. Any offence after the second one leads \nto Red card. If they showed a red card to a player it means \nthat player is expelled from the match. A straight red card (no \nprevious caution) can be shown for extreme offences, such \nas, serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, deliberately \nhandling the ball to prevent a goal, a professional foul (denying \na goal scoring opportunity) and insulting language and/or \ngestures.\nFree kicks\nWhenever a free kick is taken, the players on the opposite \nside must be at least 10 yards away from the ball until it \nis kicked. If this rule is not adhered to, the kick is retaken. \nThere are two types of free kicks awarded, depending on the \nnature of the offence: (i) Direct Free Kick — allows the team \nto take a direct shot at the opponent`s goal. (ii) Indirect Free \nKick — a direct strike on goal is not permitted. It means a \nsecond player has to touch the ball after the kick is taken to \nscore a goal.\nPenalty kick\nA penalty kick is awarded for offences taking place in the \npenalty and goal areas. A nominated member of the team is \nallowed to strike at goal from the penalty spot, with only the \ngoalkeeper to beat. The goalkeeper must remain on his line \nuntil the ball has been kicked, and all other players must be \noutside the penalty area behind the penalty spot.

It \nis delivered on the field of play with both hands and from \nbehind and over the player’s head. Otherwise it is deemed to \nbe a foul throw and a throw-in is given to the opposition. It \ncannot go directly to the goalkeeper’s hands (if on the same \nteam). A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.\nCorner kick\nA corner kick is awarded once the whole ball crosses the goal \nline of the opposition, after touching one of their players. \nA kick is taken from the corner of whichever side the ball \ntravelled over the field. Opponents must be 10 yards from \nthe corner arc and the kicker cannot touch the ball a second \ntime without having touched by any other player.\nFundamental skills\nReceiving\nReceiving a ball on the ground is different than receiving a \nball in air. Keep your eye on the ball, select the foot to receive \nthe ball, don’t stop the ball, prepare it for new action or move, \nshot, dribble, pass.\nPassing\nPassing involves giving the ball to partners. Perfect decision \nmaking is required before a perfect pass. Before pass,  \nsee the target, approach the ball, and look at the ball holding \nthe head steady. Strike the correct area of the ball with \nlacked ankle, make sure of follow through and transfer of \nweight forward.\nShooting\nShooting uses the same elements as used in passing, the \ndifference is that the ball is to be passed to the goal keeper to \nconvert the score for the team. Player should look up to see \nthe position of goal keeper, choosing the area to shoot the \nball while make a proper contact with the ball with proper \nfollow through.\nTrapping\nIt is a method of gaining control of the ball. Trapping uses \nthe feet, thigh, or chest to bring the ball to the ground.\nChap-6.indd   96 8/24/2020   11:39:34 AM\n2024-25",

However, the name Field Hockey is used in countries \nin which the word Hockey is generally reserved for another \nform of hockey, such as ice hockey or street hockey. \nThe players should learn and practice the basic skills of \ndribbling, passing, tapping and hitting. They should learn \nhow to attack and score goals and how to work with others \nto defend and stop goals from being scored. To do this they \nneed to learn how to keep possession by dribbling effectively \nand moving the ball accurately and quickly between players. \nAs they progress, skills should become more consistent and \nefficient, and the players should be introduced to set play \nsituations. \nFig. 6.17: Players playing hockey\nHistory\nThe history of the game of hockey has its roots well laid in the \nworld’s early civilisations. One of the oldest known sports, the \nhockey game is believed to be in existence about 1200 years \nbefore the Ancient Games of Olympia.

Even though many ancient \ncivilisations played hockey in different variations, the modern \ngame of field hockey was developed in the British Isles in the \n19th century. It was introduced in India by the British Army \nregiments and the game soon became popular. It was during \nthis time that the London Hockey Association was formed \nand the rules for playing hockey were standardised. In 1924, \nthe International Hockey Federation (FIH) was founded and \nthree years later, the International Federation of Women’s \nHockey followed.\nIn India, the first hockey club came up in Calcutta in \n1885-86 and soon Bombay and Punjab followed. Making \nits Olympic debut at the 1928 Amsterdam Games, Indian \nhockey team won its first Olympic gold, without conceding \na single goal. The hallmark of this ruthless domination was \nthe wizardry of Indian hockey legend, Dhyan Chand, who \nmesmerised the Amsterdam crowd with his dazzling skills. \nFrom 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold \nmedals, while winning 24 consecutive matches.

Each team works together \nto hit an inflated ball over a high net. Each team tries to \nscore points by grounding the ball on the other team’s court. \nVolleyball is a rebound game where one cannot hold or catch \nthe ball; every contact must be a rebound action. It is essential \nfor the player to be in the right place at the right time if \nthe game is to be played in a controlled manner. Therefore,  \ngood anticipation and movement skills should be taught \nto players. At competency level, students should learn and \npractice the basic skills of sending and receiving the ball over \na high net. They should play simple 3 touch volleyball games \nworking as a team to keep the ball in play and ground it on \nthe opponent’s side of the court.\nHistory\nOriginally named Mintonette, it was created as a gentle indoor \nsport for older players to be able to exert a bit of athletic \neffort by keeping the ball in the air. The idea of using a net \nwas borrowed from tennis. It was raised to a height above \nthe average man’s height. During a demonstration game, \nsomeone remarked that the players seemed to be volleying \nthe ball back and forth over the net, and perhaps “volleyball” \nwould be a more descriptive name for the sport. The game \nof Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in the year \n1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts by YMCA (USA). It was \ninvented as a recreational game. This game was brought to \nIndia more than 85 years ago when some physical education \nChap-6.indd   102 8/24/2020   11:39:36 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 27 ---\nTeam Games and sporTs I\n103\nteachers had been abroad and were trained in different  \ngames including Volleyball. YMCA College of Physical \nEducation, Madras, took this game seriously and students \ntrained there have taken the game to other parts of  \nthe country.\nFig. 6.19: Players playing volleyball\nMeasurements\nSide Line\nEndline Endline\n9m\n3-8m\n9m\nService Zone\nBack Zone\nFront\nZone\nFront\nZone\nBack Zone\nAttack line\nCentrelineand net\nAttack line\n3m 3m 3-8m\n9m\nService Zone\n9m\nA Antenna\nFig. 6.20: Specifications of volleyball court\nChap-6.indd   103 8/24/2020   11:39:38 AM\n2024-25",

It can be played indoors or outdoors. A player \non one of the teams begins a ‘rally’ by serving the ball \nfrom behind the back line of the court, over the net, \nand into the receiving team’s court. The receiving team \nmust not let the ball be grounded within their court. \nThe rally continues, with each team allowed up to three \nconsecutive touches, until either a team grounds the ball \non the opponent’s court and wins the rally or a team \ncommits a fault and loses the rally. The team that wins \nthe rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball to start \nthe next rally.

Wet dreams is a discharge of semen \n(seminal fluid) containing sperms. Many adolescent boys are \nusually not aware of this phenomenon and get worried when \nthey face this situation first time.\nSemen is the fluid formed by glands associated with male \nreproductive system. Semen carries mature sperms formed \nin the testes.\nRead the following case studies which confirm the \nuniqueness of every individual with regard to time of \noccurrence of changes during adolescence.\nCASE 1: My father calls me ‘Sher’\nRakesh and Dibang, students of Class IX, are walking home \ntogether from school. Rakesh begins to tease Dibang, saying \nthat he speaks in a girl’s voice. He also laughs at the fact \nthat Dibang has got no hair on his upper lip. “Look at me,” \nRakesh says, “I am a real man. My voice is strong and my \nface is manly - I have so much facial hair. My father calls me \nsher.” Dibang wonders what is wrong with him. He recalls \nthat his mother still calls him ‘my sweet boy’. He decides \nto go home and ask his mother why he is so different from \nRakesh and whether something is wrong with him.\nPoints for Discussion\n a) What do you think Dibang felt with Rakesh’s remarks?\n b) Do you think that there is something wrong with \nDibang? Why?\nChap-3.indd   26 8/24/2020   4:15:39 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nGrowth and development durinG adolescence\n27\n c) What should Dibang’s mother tell him?\n d) Do you think it is important to prepare children \nregarding the  changes likely to occur in them? Why?\nCASE 2: Each one is unique\nPooja, Sujatha, Abida and Radha are good friends. All of \nthem are 13 years old and love to spend time with one \nanother. They have so much to talk about, a new film, a \nnew dress, home work, the boys in the class and just about \neverything.\nYesterday, Radha seemed uncomfortable. She was \nhaving her periods and was concerned about staining her \nuniform. Last month, Sujatha’s family had organised a big \ncelebration in her honour as she had started her periods. \nPooja recalled that three months ago, Abida had started her \nperiods in school and had to borrow a sanitary napkin from \nher older cousin. Except Pooja, all her friends have started \ntheir periods. Is there something wrong with her?\nPoints for Discussion\n a) What do you think Pooja felt when she realised that \nshe is the only one who had not started her periods?\n b) Do you think there is something wrong with Pooja?\n c) If Pooja came to you for advice, what would you tell \nher as a peer?\n d) Do you think it is important to prepare children \nregarding the changes likely to occur in them? Why?\nCASE 3: Puberty in boys\nSuresh heard from someone that wet dream (nocturnal \nemission) causes weakness. When Naresh who is Suresh’s \nbest friend first experienced wet dream, he confided in \nSuresh. Suresh encouraged Naresh to visit the nearest \nHealth Centre to have a discussion about wet dream with \nthe doctor.\nPoints for Discussion\n a) Do you think something is wrong with Naresh?\n b) According to you, the advice given by Suresh is \ncorrect or not?\n c) What are the myths associated with wet dream?\n d) What advice was given by the doctor to Naresh?\n • Adolescence is a period of physical and emotional \nchanges which are triggered by a set of hormones. \nThese changes are part of growing up.\n • These changes occur at different times for different \nindividuals.\nChap-3.indd   27 8/24/2020   4:15:39 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n28\n • You should not compare your physical changes with \nothers – the pace at which changes take place differ \nfrom person to person.\n • It is natural to feel awkward or conscious of the changes \nthat occur but try to support each other by accepting \nthese as part of a natural process and don’t let these \ndecrease your self-confidence.\n • If you have any doubts or concerns about changes that \nare occurring to you reach out to a trusted adult or \nyou can talk to a counsellor in the adolescent friendly \nHealth Clinic near where you live.\n • Many young boys due to feeling of shame visit quacks \nand waste lot of time and money. It is best to visit the \ndoctor or the health centre. One can discuss the myths \nrelated to growing up with a trusted person (teacher, \nparents, friends).\n • There is a myth that wet dream causes weakness among \nthe males because semen is lost from the body. However \nit is not so, semen and sperms are continuously made \nin the testes and semen lost during wet dream gets \nreplaced very soon.\nmenstru Ation\nThe first menstruation is termed as menarche. In India, age \nof menarche is 12-13 years but may vary from individual to \nindividual. Menstruation generally stops between the age of \n45 and 55 years and is termed as menopause. Menopausal age \nvaries in different individuals. Age of menarche has decreased \ndue to various lifestyle changes. Menstruation hygiene and \ncleanliness is very important. Points to remember —\n • Regular bath and washing self properly are important \nfor avoiding infections, especially during menstruation.\n • Change undergarment regularly (at least once a day) \nand avoid synthetic cloth.\n • During menstruation, cloth, cloth pads or napkins should \nbe changed after every four to six hours to avoid infection.\n • One can also use sanitary napkins to manage \nmenstrual hygiene. Many girls and women also make \nsanitary napkins at home with old cloth and cotton. If \none makes a sanitary napkin at home, use only clean, \nsoft cotton cloth. Do not use old cloth that may have \nany metal or plastic parts in it like glitter, gota or hooks \nand buttons. This may hurt or cause infection.\n • If a cloth is used again as pad, it should be washed \nthoroughly with soap and dried in sun before next use \nas sunlight is an excellent disinfectant. Do not use dirty \nor damp cloth as it causes infections.\nChap-3.indd   28 8/24/2020   4:15:39 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nGrowth and development durinG adolescence\n29\n • Child With Special Need (CWSN) should be shown the \nprocess of maintaining hygiene or explained in detail  \nif necessary. \n • Sanitary pads should be wrapped in paper and disposed \nin trash bins or buried deep in a pit. Some schools have \nIncinerators which offer another safe way to dispose \nsanitary pads. There should be no shame attached in \nthe process of disposing sanitary pads.\nGovernment is supporting schemes for promoting menstrual \nhygiene among adolescent girls (10-19 years). Sanitary \nnapkins are made available in schools or by ASHAs at a  \nsubsidised rate.\npsychosoci Al chAnGes durinG Adolescence\nPsychosocial changes mean changes in thoughts, mood, \nattractions and friendships. The word ‘social’ is associated \nwith the word ‘society’. As adolescence sets in, a boy or girl \nbecomes psychologically aware of self and society. As a result, \nthe adolescents build their own image and personality. This \ngives confidence to the adolescent to move in the society.\nAdolescence is a transitional phase between childhood and \nadulthood. During this transitional period the adolescents \nget confused regarding their emerging role in the family \nand society at large. The physical changes in adolescents \nare accompanied by psychosocial changes. Adolescents get \nattracted towards opposite sex or become part of a peer \ngroup. Such changes tend to make them more dependent on \nthe peer group in neighborhood, among classmates, etc. This \noften creates stressful relationships with parents, teachers \nand elders. Sometimes these developments may make them \ninsecure about future. Adolescents who become aware of \nthese changes, overcome this phase comfortably. \nThe social changes are reflected in the behavior of \nadolescents with peers and parents. They differ from parents \non many issues and develop the confidence to express \ntheir own opinion emphatically if parents are friendly and \nunderstanding.  Adolescents are more friendly with their \npeer group. However belonging to a vulnerable age group, \nadolescents may feel pressurised under the influence of \npeers.  Everyone feels the need to have friends but during \nadolescence the need for friendship is more pronounced.  \nThe friendship may be with a peer or relative of one’s own \nage and someone of own sex or the other sex. It is, therefore, \nimportant for them to identify with whom they can share \ntheir ideas and identify ‘safety net’ in friends, parents and \nteachers. \nActivity 3.2\nSome psychological \nchanges that occur in an \nadolescent are mentioned \nhere. Write one or two \nsentences regarding them \nfrom your own experience. \nYou may quote incidents \ninvolving others of your \nage.\n • Developing a sense of \nidentity. \n • Distancing from parents.\n • Closeness with peers.\n • Curiosity for gaining \nknowledge.\n • Experimentation\nChap-3.indd   29 8/24/2020   4:15:39 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n30\nAdolescent  or teenAGe preGnAncy\nAn adolescent is capable of reproduction. However, the \nreproductive maturity is reached only when a teenager is fully \ndeveloped physically and physiologically. In India, because \nof early marriage, there are large number of adolescents or \nteenage pregnancies. If pregnancy occurs before reaching \ncomplete reproductive maturity, girls may risk their own \nhealth and that of the fetus (developing embryo).\nRisks involved in adolescent pregnancy are mentioned  \nbelow —\n • An adolescent mother is not mentally prepared for \nmotherhood.\n • An adolescent mother is likely to be anemic. \n • An adolescent mother is more prone towards maternal \ndeath while giving birth.\n • Infant death are more among teenage mothers.\n • There is likelihood of developing complications during \ngiving birth.\n • The baby born from teenage mother requires greater \ncare which the teenage mother may not be able to give.\n • The reproductive tract may be damaged during \nchildbirth.\n • Early pregnancy and motherhood delays development \nof education and career of adolescent mother.\n • There may be economic problems and also problems \ndue to psychological immaturity of the adolescent \nmother. This may hamper proper care of the infant.\nActivity 3.3\nRead the case study given below. Think and answer the questions \nthat follow. \nRahul’s grandmother and Sangeeta’s grandmother were great \nfriends. When Rahul grew up, his grandmother would often ask \nhim to drop Sangeeta at her home. As a result Rahul and Sangeeta \ndeveloped a liking for each other. When Sangeeta turned sixteen, \nthe grandmothers insisted that Rahul and Sangeeta be married \noff as they were developing a relationship and that people would \ntalk about it. Rahul was in college and Sangeeta had yet to \nfinish school when they got married. After six months Sangeeta \ndiscovered that she was pregnant. Sangeeta was sad as she had \ndreams of pursuing higher studies and a career.\n1.\n Were Rahul and Sangeeta right in agreeing \nto get married? \nGive reasons for your answer."

While you must maintain hygiene of all \nexternal parts, the internal organs also have to function \nnormally. You know that certain vital functions of the body \nfor enjoying good health are maintenance of blood pressure, \npulse rate, respiratory rate, etc. Some ways of assessing \nthe vital functions and statistics of human beings are  \ngiven below. \nBlood pressure (BP) and its measurement\nPressure exerted \nby blood on the \nwall of the arteries \nis called blood \npressure. When \nthe heart \ncontracts, blood \nsurges through \naorta, BP is \nhighest (Systolic \nPressure) \npressure \nof blood on the arterial wall recorded when ventricles relax is \nlowest (Diastolic Pressure).\nThe pressure wave \nalong the arteries with \neach heartbeat can be \nfelt at the pulse. Blood \npressure is measured \nby the instrument \ncalled “Sphygmoma-\nnometer”. Diastolic \nand Systolic pressure \nis measured and in a \nnormal healthy young \nadult it is 110/75, \nwhich means 110 \nmm Hg systolic and \n75 mm Hg diastolic. \nSphygmomanometer \nconsists of cuff with \nan inflatable bladder which is wrapped around a person’s up-\nper arm and a rubber bulb inflates the bladder. An attached \ndevice indicates the blood pressure. There is now a digital de -\nvice which is also used for measuring the BP. BP increases \nwith age to about 130/90mm Hg. Abnormally high BP is called \nhypertension. \nFig. 3.1: Checking blood pressure\nFig. 3.3: Sphygmomanometer\nActivity 3.4\nMeasuring mid-arm \nCircumference\nBiceps is the muscle of  \nmid arm.\nPlace the beginning of the \ntapes in the middle of the \nbiceps (midway between \nshoulder and elbow joint) \ntake the reading and \nrecord it. When you do \nthis in a group, record the \ncircumference of all the \nstudents of the group and \nobserve the variation.\nFig. 3.2: Measuring mid-arm \ncircumference\nChap-3.indd   31 8/24/2020   4:15:40 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n32\nCalculate your Body Mass Index (BMI)\nBMI can be calculated by adopting the following formula. \nDivide your weight by square of your height.\nBMI =\nweight (kg)\nheight (m)\n2\n • If you measured your weight in kg then measure height \nin meters. \n • Normal BMI Range = 18 to 25.\n • Overweight = more than 25 and less then 29.\n • Obese = more than 30.\nExamination of conjunction \nThe conjunction is a transparent membrane over the eye.  \nA smooth shiny moist conjunction is normal. If red or thick or \ncovered by a secretion or foreign body, it requires immediate \nmedical attention or consultation of a eye doctor. \nTongue examination\nNutritional deficiencies, infections, dysfunction of nerves or \neven cancer can be detected by examining the tongue.\nSome key characteristic features of a tongue in normal \ncondition can be noted by physical examination. These are —\n (i) Colour: Pink red on both upper and lower surface. On \nlower surface blood vessels may be seen.\n (ii) Texture: Rough on upper surface due to presence of \npapillae or taste buds. Hair, farrows or ulceration \nindicates dysfunction.\n (iii) Size: If not swollen, tongue will fit comfortably inside \nthe mouth. The tongue can be examined by the \nfollowing steps —\n • Make tip of tongue touch roof of mouth to inspect \nventral surface.\n • When protruded out, colour and texture can be \nnoted for any deviation.\n • Use gauze to hold protruded tongue (wearing \ngloves) between tongue and index figure and fill \nthe fender areas.\nExamining nail bed\nNail bed also needs direct physical examination. Nail plate \nsurface discolouration, abnormal cuticle, nail fold or nail \nshape require inspection. Loss of nails and lesions around \nnails, need medical attention.\nActivity 3.6\nAt the exit gate of Nehru \nPlace Metro Station in \nNew Delhi, there is a \nprovision for measuring \nheight and weight and \nalso to calculate BMI for \n10 rupees. Find out where \nelse measurement of BMI \nis available. Do you have \nthis in your school?\n • My Height =\n • My Weight =\n • My BMI=\nNormal, Overweight, obese. \nTick whichever is relevant\nActivity 3.5\nMeasuring height\n • Take your own height \nat intervals as you \ngrow. You have learnt \nthat your height at \nage 19 is almost the \nmaximum height that \nyou shall attain. Do \nthis with your friends \nand try to figure out the \nreasons for variations. \nYou need only an inch \ntape for this.\n • Go to a clinic or any \nmedical practitioner \nand see the working \nof the Sphygmoma-\nnometer. Collect data \nfrom persons where \nBP is checked. Analyse \nthe variations and the  \nreasons.\nChap-3.indd   32 8/24/2020   4:15:40 PM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nGrowth and development durinG adolescence\n33\nPharmacology and its impact on the body\nPharmacology deals with biological effects of drugs.

Wet dreams is a discharge of semen \n(seminal fluid) containing sperms. Many adolescent boys are \nusually not aware of this phenomenon and get worried when \nthey face this situation first time.\nSemen is the fluid formed by glands associated with male \nreproductive system. Semen carries mature sperms formed \nin the testes.\nRead the following case studies which confirm the \nuniqueness of every individual with regard to time of \noccurrence of changes during adolescence.\nCASE 1: My father calls me ‘Sher’\nRakesh and Dibang, students of Class IX, are walking home \ntogether from school. Rakesh begins to tease Dibang, saying \nthat he speaks in a girl’s voice. He also laughs at the fact \nthat Dibang has got no hair on his upper lip. “Look at me,” \nRakesh says, “I am a real man. My voice is strong and my \nface is manly - I have so much facial hair. My father calls me \nsher.” Dibang wonders what is wrong with him. He recalls \nthat his mother still calls him ‘my sweet boy’. He decides \nto go home and ask his mother why he is so different from \nRakesh and whether something is wrong with him.\nPoints for Discussion\n a) What do you think Dibang felt with Rakesh’s remarks?\n b) Do you think that there is something wrong with \nDibang?

Menopausal age \nvaries in different individuals. Age of menarche has decreased \ndue to various lifestyle changes. Menstruation hygiene and \ncleanliness is very important. Points to remember —\n • Regular bath and washing self properly are important \nfor avoiding infections, especially during menstruation.\n • Change undergarment regularly (at least once a day) \nand avoid synthetic cloth.\n • During menstruation, cloth, cloth pads or napkins should \nbe changed after every four to six hours to avoid infection.\n • One can also use sanitary napkins to manage \nmenstrual hygiene. Many girls and women also make \nsanitary napkins at home with old cloth and cotton. If \none makes a sanitary napkin at home, use only clean, \nsoft cotton cloth. Do not use old cloth that may have \nany metal or plastic parts in it like glitter, gota or hooks \nand buttons. This may hurt or cause infection.\n • If a cloth is used again as pad, it should be washed \nthoroughly with soap and dried in sun before next use \nas sunlight is an excellent disinfectant. Do not use dirty \nor damp cloth as it causes infections.\nChap-3.indd   28 8/24/2020   4:15:39 PM\n2024-25",

The word ‘social’ is associated \nwith the word ‘society’. As adolescence sets in, a boy or girl \nbecomes psychologically aware of self and society. As a result, \nthe adolescents build their own image and personality. This \ngives confidence to the adolescent to move in the society.\nAdolescence is a transitional phase between childhood and \nadulthood. During this transitional period the adolescents \nget confused regarding their emerging role in the family \nand society at large. The physical changes in adolescents \nare accompanied by psychosocial changes. Adolescents get \nattracted towards opposite sex or become part of a peer \ngroup. Such changes tend to make them more dependent on \nthe peer group in neighborhood, among classmates, etc. This \noften creates stressful relationships with parents, teachers \nand elders. Sometimes these developments may make them \ninsecure about future. Adolescents who become aware of \nthese changes, overcome this phase comfortably. \nThe social changes are reflected in the behavior of \nadolescents with peers and parents. They differ from parents \non many issues and develop the confidence to express \ntheir own opinion emphatically if parents are friendly and \nunderstanding.  Adolescents are more friendly with their \npeer group. However belonging to a vulnerable age group, \nadolescents may feel pressurised under the influence of \npeers.  Everyone feels the need to have friends but during \nadolescence the need for friendship is more pronounced.  \nThe friendship may be with a peer or relative of one’s own \nage and someone of own sex or the other sex. It is, therefore, \nimportant for them to identify with whom they can share \ntheir ideas and identify ‘safety net’ in friends, parents and \nteachers. \nActivity 3.2\nSome psychological \nchanges that occur in an \nadolescent are mentioned \nhere. Write one or two \nsentences regarding them \nfrom your own experience. \nYou may quote incidents \ninvolving others of your \nage.\n • Developing a sense of \nidentity. \n • Distancing from parents.\n • Closeness with peers.\n • Curiosity for gaining \nknowledge.\n • Experimentation\nChap-3.indd   29 8/24/2020   4:15:39 PM\n2024-25",

While you must maintain hygiene of all \nexternal parts, the internal organs also have to function \nnormally. You know that certain vital functions of the body \nfor enjoying good health are maintenance of blood pressure, \npulse rate, respiratory rate, etc. Some ways of assessing \nthe vital functions and statistics of human beings are  \ngiven below. \nBlood pressure (BP) and its measurement\nPressure exerted \nby blood on the \nwall of the arteries \nis called blood \npressure. When \nthe heart \ncontracts, blood \nsurges through \naorta, BP is \nhighest (Systolic \nPressure) \npressure \nof blood on the arterial wall recorded when ventricles relax is \nlowest (Diastolic Pressure).\nThe pressure wave \nalong the arteries with \neach heartbeat can be \nfelt at the pulse. Blood \npressure is measured \nby the instrument \ncalled “Sphygmoma-\nnometer”. Diastolic \nand Systolic pressure \nis measured and in a \nnormal healthy young \nadult it is 110/75, \nwhich means 110 \nmm Hg systolic and \n75 mm Hg diastolic. \nSphygmomanometer \nconsists of cuff with \nan inflatable bladder which is wrapped around a person’s up-\nper arm and a rubber bulb inflates the bladder. An attached \ndevice indicates the blood pressure. There is now a digital de -\nvice which is also used for measuring the BP. BP increases \nwith age to about 130/90mm Hg. Abnormally high BP is called \nhypertension. \nFig. 3.1: Checking blood pressure\nFig. 3.3: Sphygmomanometer\nActivity 3.4\nMeasuring mid-arm \nCircumference\nBiceps is the muscle of  \nmid arm.\nPlace the beginning of the \ntapes in the middle of the \nbiceps (midway between \nshoulder and elbow joint) \ntake the reading and \nrecord it.

The drop of pure milk either stops \nor flows slowly leaving a white trail behind \nit. On the other hand, milk adulterated with \nwater flows immediately without leaving a \nmark. \nMilk\nStarch \nAdd 2-3 drops of tincture iodine. Formation \nof blue color indicates the presence of \nstarch.\nUrea\nTake 5 ml milk sample in a test tube. Add \n5 ml Para-dimethyl Amino Benzaldehyde \nreagent. Appearance of distinct yellow color \nindicates presence of added urea whereas \nformation of slight yellow color indicates \nnatural urea in milk.\nMustard Seeds Argemone Seeds\nArgemone seeds have rough surface and \nare tinier in size and black in color. Mustard \nseeds on pressing are yellow inside, while \nargemone seeds are white.\nSugar Chalk Dissolve sugar in a glass of water, chalk \nwill settle down at the bottom. \nSilver Foil Aluminium Foil\nOn ignition genuine silver foil burns \naway completely leaving glistening white \nspherical ball of the same mass while \naluminum foil is reduced to ashes of black \ngrey color.\nHoney Sugar solution \nA cotton wick dipped in pure honey \nburns when ignited with a match stick. \nIf adulterated, presence of water will not \nallow the honey to burn and if it does, it \nwill produce a crackling sound.\nCoffee Chicory\nGently sprinkle the coffee powder on the \nsurface of water in a glass.  The coffee \nfloats over the water but chicory begins to \nsink within a few seconds.  \nTea\nColoured Leaves\nPour water drop by drop at the heap of the \ntea leaves placed on a filter paper. Water \nwill dissolve the added colour and leave \nstreak of colour. \nIron filings Move a magnet through the sample. Iron \nwill stick to the magnet.\nRed Chilli \nPowder\nRodamine\nTake 2 gms sample in a test tube, add 5 ml \nof acetone. Immediate appearance of red \ncolor indicates presence of Rodamine.\nSaw dust\nAdd the sample to water. The saw dust \nwill float at the surface of water while chilli \npowder will settle down in bottom.\nChap-9.indd   175 8/24/2020   11:43:37 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n176\nTurmeric \nPowder Artificial colour\nNatural turmeric powder leaves a light \nyellow colour while settling down whereas \nadulterated turmeric powder will leave a \nstrong yellow colour in water.\nDal — arhar, \nhuskless moong \nand  channa\nMetanil Yellow\nExtract the color with lukewarm water \nfrom the sample of pulses, add drops of \nHCl.  A pink color indicates presence of \nmetanil yellow.\nGreen \nvegetables like \npeas, bitter \ngourd\nMalachite Green\nTake a cotton piece soaked in water or \nvegetable oil.  Rub the outer green surface \nof the vegetable. If the cotton turns green, \nthen it is adulterated with malachite green.\nPlace a small portion of the peel (from the \ngreen side) on a moistened white blotting \npaper, green colour on paper indicates the \npresence of malachite green.\nBlack Pepper Papaya Seeds\nPure black pepper settles at the bottom \nwhereas papaya seeds float on the surface \nof water.\nSaffron\nColored dried \ntendrils of maize \ncob\nPure saffron will not break easily. Pure \nsaffron when dissolved in water will \ncontinue to give out colour till it remains \nin water.\nCommon Salt Chalk \nStir a spoonful of salt in water. Chalk \nwill make the solution white and other \ninsoluble impurities will settle down.\nAs a part of its mandate to ensure safe food to the citizens, \nFood Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) \nconducts testing of food for different types of adulterants, \nchemical and micro-biological contaminants and other \nsafety parameters for food. The food testing is done by FSSAI \nthrough a network of FSSAI notified laboratories across \nthe country. The food safety officers collect samples of food \nproducts for testing. A consumer can also get the samples \nof food tested in such labs. If the food is found unsafe after \ntesting, the cost of the test is reimbursed to the consumer. \nAdverse effects of food adulteration on health\nAdulteration is detrimental to health. Many a times food \nis adulterated in such a way that it looks the same but \nsoon it may change in taste, appearance and nutritional \ncomposition, often leading to harmful effects on health. \nConsuming adulterated food can cause the symptoms like \ndiarrhea, vomiting, headache, abdominal cramps, fatigue, \netc. Sometimes its impact may not be instantly visible but \nmay distort the functioning of the immune, digestive and \nnervous system. It can also lead to liver disorder, heart \ndisease, paralysis, brain damage, cancer, etc. Consumption \nChap-9.indd   176 8/24/2020   11:43:37 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nDietary ConsiDerations anD FooD Quality\n177\nof adulterated food by pregnant women may lead to abortion \nor damage the brain of the baby.

Chemical \npesticides have played a significant role in increasing food \nproduction, but unnecessary and excessive use of these \nover a long period of time has adversely influenced various \nforms of life on earth, as well as, the quality of soil, water \nand environment. These have disrupted the natural balance \nof the ecosystem. \nPesticides often leave their residues in food which are \npassed on to the body. Those at higher risks are workers \nhandling or producing pesticides as pesticides are toxic in \nnature. The adverse effects of pesticide residues depend on \nthe type and amount of the pesticide and the route (ingestion \nor inhalation) and duration of exposure. If pesticide is used \nin accordance with good agricultural practice, the residual \nlevel would be low and consumption of such foods will not \nbe harmful. Symptoms of acute poisoning include vomiting, \ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness. In severe \ncases, it may lead to difficulties in breathing, blurred vision \nand convulsion. Pesticides can cause damage to the brain \nand nervous system, liver, kidneys and are specially harmful \nto fetus. In India, FSSAI is responsible for setting maximum \nresidue limits (MRLs) for the pesticides.\nActivity 9.7\n • Search any two cases \nof food adulteration \n(personal experience, \nnews item, internet, \netc.), identify \nadulterant and its \neffect on health. \n • Whom can you \napproach when you \nsee fungus on bread; \nsuspect water in milk \nor find ice cream sold \nafter the expiry date?\n • Conduct a survey on \n10 persons to assess \ntheir actions on food \nsafety asking simple \nquestions like whether \nthey check sign of \nquality standard \n(FSSAI, Agmark \netc.), date of expiry, \ningredients, visual \ncondition of product, \npackage, etc., while \nbuying. Make a report \nand discuss in class.\nChap-9.indd   177 8/24/2020   11:43:37 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n178\nSome preventive measures\n • Young children, pregnant and lactating women, weak \nand sick persons are at higher risk, hence they should \nbe specially protected. \n • Use herbal or bio-pesticides. \n • Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly under clean \nrunning water.\n • Use organic food.\n • Keep the pesticides in locked cabinets, away from \nkitchen and bathroom. \n • Read all labels and warnings carefully before using \npesticides.\nSuggested readings "

Chemical \npesticides have played a significant role in increasing food \nproduction, but unnecessary and excessive use of these \nover a long period of time has adversely influenced various \nforms of life on earth, as well as, the quality of soil, water \nand environment. These have disrupted the natural balance \nof the ecosystem. \nPesticides often leave their residues in food which are \npassed on to the body. Those at higher risks are workers \nhandling or producing pesticides as pesticides are toxic in \nnature. The adverse effects of pesticide residues depend on \nthe type and amount of the pesticide and the route (ingestion \nor inhalation) and duration of exposure. If pesticide is used \nin accordance with good agricultural practice, the residual \nlevel would be low and consumption of such foods will not \nbe harmful. Symptoms of acute poisoning include vomiting, \ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness. In severe \ncases, it may lead to difficulties in breathing, blurred vision \nand convulsion. Pesticides can cause damage to the brain \nand nervous system, liver, kidneys and are specially harmful \nto fetus. In India, FSSAI is responsible for setting maximum \nresidue limits (MRLs) for the pesticides.\nActivity 9.7\n • Search any two cases \nof food adulteration \n(personal experience, \nnews item, internet, \netc.), identify \nadulterant and its \neffect on health. \n • Whom can you \napproach when you \nsee fungus on bread; \nsuspect water in milk \nor find ice cream sold \nafter the expiry date?\n • Conduct a survey on \n10 persons to assess \ntheir actions on food \nsafety asking simple \nquestions like whether \nthey check sign of \nquality standard \n(FSSAI, Agmark \netc.), date of expiry, \ningredients, visual \ncondition of product, \npackage, etc., while \nbuying.
