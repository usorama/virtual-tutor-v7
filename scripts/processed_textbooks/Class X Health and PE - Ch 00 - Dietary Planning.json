The drop of pure milk either stops \nor flows slowly leaving a white trail behind \nit. On the other hand, milk adulterated with \nwater flows immediately without leaving a \nmark. \nMilk\nStarch \nAdd 2-3 drops of tincture iodine. Formation \nof blue color indicates the presence of \nstarch.\nUrea\nTake 5 ml milk sample in a test tube. Add \n5 ml Para-dimethyl Amino Benzaldehyde \nreagent. Appearance of distinct yellow color \nindicates presence of added urea whereas \nformation of slight yellow color indicates \nnatural urea in milk.\nMustard Seeds Argemone Seeds\nArgemone seeds have rough surface and \nare tinier in size and black in color. Mustard \nseeds on pressing are yellow inside, while \nargemone seeds are white.\nSugar Chalk Dissolve sugar in a glass of water, chalk \nwill settle down at the bottom. \nSilver Foil Aluminium Foil\nOn ignition genuine silver foil burns \naway completely leaving glistening white \nspherical ball of the same mass while \naluminum foil is reduced to ashes of black \ngrey color.\nHoney Sugar solution \nA cotton wick dipped in pure honey \nburns when ignited with a match stick. \nIf adulterated, presence of water will not \nallow the honey to burn and if it does, it \nwill produce a crackling sound.\nCoffee Chicory\nGently sprinkle the coffee powder on the \nsurface of water in a glass.  The coffee \nfloats over the water but chicory begins to \nsink within a few seconds.  \nTea\nColoured Leaves\nPour water drop by drop at the heap of the \ntea leaves placed on a filter paper. Water \nwill dissolve the added colour and leave \nstreak of colour. \nIron filings Move a magnet through the sample. Iron \nwill stick to the magnet.\nRed Chilli \nPowder\nRodamine\nTake 2 gms sample in a test tube, add 5 ml \nof acetone. Immediate appearance of red \ncolor indicates presence of Rodamine.\nSaw dust\nAdd the sample to water. The saw dust \nwill float at the surface of water while chilli \npowder will settle down in bottom.\nChap-9.indd   175 8/24/2020   11:43:37 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n176\nTurmeric \nPowder Artificial colour\nNatural turmeric powder leaves a light \nyellow colour while settling down whereas \nadulterated turmeric powder will leave a \nstrong yellow colour in water.\nDal — arhar, \nhuskless moong \nand  channa\nMetanil Yellow\nExtract the color with lukewarm water \nfrom the sample of pulses, add drops of \nHCl.  A pink color indicates presence of \nmetanil yellow.\nGreen \nvegetables like \npeas, bitter \ngourd\nMalachite Green\nTake a cotton piece soaked in water or \nvegetable oil.  Rub the outer green surface \nof the vegetable. If the cotton turns green, \nthen it is adulterated with malachite green.\nPlace a small portion of the peel (from the \ngreen side) on a moistened white blotting \npaper, green colour on paper indicates the \npresence of malachite green.\nBlack Pepper Papaya Seeds\nPure black pepper settles at the bottom \nwhereas papaya seeds float on the surface \nof water.\nSaffron\nColored dried \ntendrils of maize \ncob\nPure saffron will not break easily. Pure \nsaffron when dissolved in water will \ncontinue to give out colour till it remains \nin water.\nCommon Salt Chalk \nStir a spoonful of salt in water. Chalk \nwill make the solution white and other \ninsoluble impurities will settle down.\nAs a part of its mandate to ensure safe food to the citizens, \nFood Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) \nconducts testing of food for different types of adulterants, \nchemical and micro-biological contaminants and other \nsafety parameters for food. The food testing is done by FSSAI \nthrough a network of FSSAI notified laboratories across \nthe country. The food safety officers collect samples of food \nproducts for testing. A consumer can also get the samples \nof food tested in such labs. If the food is found unsafe after \ntesting, the cost of the test is reimbursed to the consumer. \nAdverse effects of food adulteration on health\nAdulteration is detrimental to health. Many a times food \nis adulterated in such a way that it looks the same but \nsoon it may change in taste, appearance and nutritional \ncomposition, often leading to harmful effects on health. \nConsuming adulterated food can cause the symptoms like \ndiarrhea, vomiting, headache, abdominal cramps, fatigue, \netc. Sometimes its impact may not be instantly visible but \nmay distort the functioning of the immune, digestive and \nnervous system. It can also lead to liver disorder, heart \ndisease, paralysis, brain damage, cancer, etc. Consumption \nChap-9.indd   176 8/24/2020   11:43:37 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nDietary ConsiDerations anD FooD Quality\n177\nof adulterated food by pregnant women may lead to abortion \nor damage the brain of the baby.

These have disrupted the natural balance \nof the ecosystem. \nPesticides often leave their residues in food which are \npassed on to the body. Those at higher risks are workers \nhandling or producing pesticides as pesticides are toxic in \nnature. The adverse effects of pesticide residues depend on \nthe type and amount of the pesticide and the route (ingestion \nor inhalation) and duration of exposure. If pesticide is used \nin accordance with good agricultural practice, the residual \nlevel would be low and consumption of such foods will not \nbe harmful. Symptoms of acute poisoning include vomiting, \ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness. In severe \ncases, it may lead to difficulties in breathing, blurred vision \nand convulsion. Pesticides can cause damage to the brain \nand nervous system, liver, kidneys and are specially harmful \nto fetus. In India, FSSAI is responsible for setting maximum \nresidue limits (MRLs) for the pesticides.\nActivity 9.7\n • Search any two cases \nof food adulteration \n(personal experience, \nnews item, internet, \netc.), identify \nadulterant and its \neffect on health. \n • Whom can you \napproach when you \nsee fungus on bread; \nsuspect water in milk \nor find ice cream sold \nafter the expiry date?\n • Conduct a survey on \n10 persons to assess \ntheir actions on food \nsafety asking simple \nquestions like whether \nthey check sign of \nquality standard \n(FSSAI, Agmark \netc.), date of expiry, \ningredients, visual \ncondition of product, \npackage, etc., while \nbuying. Make a report \nand discuss in class.\nChap-9.indd   177 8/24/2020   11:43:37 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nHealtH and PHysical education - class X\n178\nSome preventive measures\n • Young children, pregnant and lactating women, weak \nand sick persons are at higher risk, hence they should \nbe specially protected. \n • Use herbal or bio-pesticides. \n • Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly under clean \nrunning water.\n • Use organic food.\n • Keep the pesticides in locked cabinets, away from \nkitchen and bathroom. \n • Read all labels and warnings carefully before using \npesticides.\nSuggested readings "

The drop of pure milk either stops \nor flows slowly leaving a white trail behind \nit. On the other hand, milk adulterated with \nwater flows immediately without leaving a \nmark. \nMilk\nStarch \nAdd 2-3 drops of tincture iodine. Formation \nof blue color indicates the presence of \nstarch.\nUrea\nTake 5 ml milk sample in a test tube. Add \n5 ml Para-dimethyl Amino Benzaldehyde \nreagent. Appearance of distinct yellow color \nindicates presence of added urea whereas \nformation of slight yellow color indicates \nnatural urea in milk.\nMustard Seeds Argemone Seeds\nArgemone seeds have rough surface and \nare tinier in size and black in color. Mustard \nseeds on pressing are yellow inside, while \nargemone seeds are white.\nSugar Chalk Dissolve sugar in a glass of water, chalk \nwill settle down at the bottom. \nSilver Foil Aluminium Foil\nOn ignition genuine silver foil burns \naway completely leaving glistening white \nspherical ball of the same mass while \naluminum foil is reduced to ashes of black \ngrey color.\nHoney Sugar solution \nA cotton wick dipped in pure honey \nburns when ignited with a match stick. \nIf adulterated, presence of water will not \nallow the honey to burn and if it does, it \nwill produce a crackling sound.\nCoffee Chicory\nGently sprinkle the coffee powder on the \nsurface of water in a glass.  The coffee \nfloats over the water but chicory begins to \nsink within a few seconds.  \nTea\nColoured Leaves\nPour water drop by drop at the heap of the \ntea leaves placed on a filter paper. Water \nwill dissolve the added colour and leave \nstreak of colour. \nIron filings Move a magnet through the sample. Iron \nwill stick to the magnet.\nRed Chilli \nPowder\nRodamine\nTake 2 gms sample in a test tube, add 5 ml \nof acetone. Immediate appearance of red \ncolor indicates presence of Rodamine.\nSaw dust\nAdd the sample to water. The saw dust \nwill float at the surface of water while chilli \npowder will settle down in bottom.\nChap-9.indd   175 8/24/2020   11:43:37 AM\n2024-25",

If the food is found unsafe after \ntesting, the cost of the test is reimbursed to the consumer. \nAdverse effects of food adulteration on health\nAdulteration is detrimental to health. Many a times food \nis adulterated in such a way that it looks the same but \nsoon it may change in taste, appearance and nutritional \ncomposition, often leading to harmful effects on health. \nConsuming adulterated food can cause the symptoms like \ndiarrhea, vomiting, headache, abdominal cramps, fatigue, \netc. Sometimes its impact may not be instantly visible but \nmay distort the functioning of the immune, digestive and \nnervous system. It can also lead to liver disorder, heart \ndisease, paralysis, brain damage, cancer, etc. Consumption \nChap-9.indd   176 8/24/2020   11:43:37 AM\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nDietary ConsiDerations anD FooD Quality\n177\nof adulterated food by pregnant women may lead to abortion \nor damage the brain of the baby.

Chemical \npesticides have played a significant role in increasing food \nproduction, but unnecessary and excessive use of these \nover a long period of time has adversely influenced various \nforms of life on earth, as well as, the quality of soil, water \nand environment. These have disrupted the natural balance \nof the ecosystem. \nPesticides often leave their residues in food which are \npassed on to the body. Those at higher risks are workers \nhandling or producing pesticides as pesticides are toxic in \nnature. The adverse effects of pesticide residues depend on \nthe type and amount of the pesticide and the route (ingestion \nor inhalation) and duration of exposure. If pesticide is used \nin accordance with good agricultural practice, the residual \nlevel would be low and consumption of such foods will not \nbe harmful. Symptoms of acute poisoning include vomiting, \ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness and numbness. In severe \ncases, it may lead to difficulties in breathing, blurred vision \nand convulsion. Pesticides can cause damage to the brain \nand nervous system, liver, kidneys and are specially harmful \nto fetus. In India, FSSAI is responsible for setting maximum \nresidue limits (MRLs) for the pesticides.\nActivity 9.7\n • Search any two cases \nof food adulteration \n(personal experience, \nnews item, internet, \netc.), identify \nadulterant and its \neffect on health. \n • Whom can you \napproach when you \nsee fungus on bread; \nsuspect water in milk \nor find ice cream sold \nafter the expiry date?\n • Conduct a survey on \n10 persons to assess \ntheir actions on food \nsafety asking simple \nquestions like whether \nthey check sign of \nquality standard \n(FSSAI, Agmark \netc.), date of expiry, \ningredients, visual \ncondition of product, \npackage, etc., while \nbuying.
