Based on\nthis evidence, suggest a possible rule for the inheritance of earlobe\ntypes.\n8.2.2 Rules for the Inheritance of T raits  – –– ––\nMendel’s Contributions\nThe rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to\nthe fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal\namounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can\nbe influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait\nthere will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in\nthe child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such\ninheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from\nmore than a century ago.\nFigure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2\n(a) Free and (b) attached\nearlobes. The lowest part\nof the ear , called the\nearlobe, is closely attached\nto the side of the head in\nsome of us, and not\nin others. Free and\nattached earlobes are two\nvariants found in human\npopulations.\ndifferent kinds of advantages. Bacteria that can withstand heat will survive\nbetter in a heat wave, as we have discussed earlier. Selection of variants\nby environmental factors forms the basis for evolutionary processes, as\nwe will discuss in later sections.\n(a)\n(b)\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nHeredity 131\nx\nRR yy\n(round, green)\nrr YY\n(wrinkled, yellow)\nRy\n rY\nRr Yy\n(round, yellow)\nF1\nx\nRr Yy\nF1\nRr Yy\nF1\n315 round, yellow\n108 round, green\n101 wrinkled, yellow\n32 wrinkled, green\n9\n3\n3\n1\n556 seeds 16\nFigure 9.5 Independent inheritance of two\nseparate traits, shape and colour of seeds\nRY Ry rY ry\nRY\nRy\nrY\nry\nRRYY RRYy RrYY RrYy\nRRYy RRyy RrYy Rryy\nRrYY RrYy rrYY rrYy\nRrYy Rryy rrYy rryy\nF2\nFigure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5Figure 8.5\nIndependent inheritance\nof two separate traits,\nshape and colour of seeds\nWhat happens when pea plants showing two different\ncharacteristics, rather than just one, are bred with each other?\nWhat do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short\nplant with wrinkled-seeds look like? They are all tall and have\nround seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits.\nBut what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate\nF2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find\nthat some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some\nwere short plants with wrinkled seeds.  However, there would also\nbe some F2 progeny that showed new combinations. Some of them\nwould be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short,\nbut have round seeds. You can see as to how new combinations of\ntraits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed\nshape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form\nF2 offspring (Fig. 8.5). Thus, the tall/short trait and the round\nseed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited.\n8.2.3 How do these Traits get Expressed?\nHow does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is\nthe information source for making proteins in the cell. A section\nof DNA that provides information for one protein is called the\ngene for that protein. How do proteins control the\ncharacteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the\nexample of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants\nhave hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus\ndepend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The\namount of the plant hormone made will depend on the\nefficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme\nthat is important for this process. If this enzyme works\nefficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be\ntall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes\nthe enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,\nand the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,\nor traits.\nIf the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been\ndiscussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing\nequally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction.\nWe have disscussed this issue in the previous Chapter. If both\nparents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents\nmust be contributing a copy of the same gene. This means that\neach pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from\neach parent. For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must\nhave only one gene set.\nHow do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two\ncopies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a\nsingle whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained\nin Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and\n‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently\nFigure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nScience132\ninherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not\nas a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,\neach called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance\nexplains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all\nsexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms\nalso follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their\ninheritance might work?\n8.2.4 Sex Determination\nWe have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual\nreproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number\nof reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual\ndetermined? Different species use very different strategies\nfor this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,\nin some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at\nwhich fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the\nanimals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In\nother animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,\nindicating that sex is not genetically determined. However,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls.\nBut so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets ar\ne\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex?\nThe explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is\nodd in not always being a per fect pair. Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,\nwhile men ar e XY . Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be?\nAs Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome\nfrom their mother regardless of whether they are boys or\ngirls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by\nwhat they inherit from their father. A child who inherits\nan X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one\nwho inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.\nFigure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6\nSex determination in\nhuman beings\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nHeredity 133\nQUESTIONS\n?"

If the\ncopies are not identical, the trait that gets expressed is called the dominant trait\nand the other is called the recessive trait.\n/square6Traits in one individual may be inherited separately, giving rise to new combinations\nof traits in the offspring of sexual reproduction.\n/square6Sex is determined by different factors in various species. In human beings, the\nsex of the child depends on whether the paternal chromosome is X (for girls) or Y\n(for boys).\nEXERCISES",
