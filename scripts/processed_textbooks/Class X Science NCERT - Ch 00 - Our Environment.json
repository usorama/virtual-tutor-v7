Changes in the environment\naffect us and our activities change the environment around us. We have\nalready seen in Class IX how our activities pollute the environment. In\nthis chapter, we shall be looking at two of the environmental problems\nin detail, that is, depletion of the ozone layer and waste disposal.\n13.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted\nOzone (O3) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O 2,\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However , at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiation\n/square6Newspaper reports about pesticide levels in ready-made food items\nare often seen these days and some states have banned these\nproducts. Debate in groups the need for such bans.\n/square6What do you think would be the source of pesticides in these food\nitems? Could pesticides get into our bodies from this source through\nother food products too?\n/square6Discuss what methods could be applied to reduce our intake of\npesticides.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nOur Environment 213\nActivity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5Activity 13.5\nActivity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4Activity 13.4\nis highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin\ncancer in human beings.\nOzone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV\nradiation acting on oxygen (O 2) molecule. The higher energy UV\nradiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O2) into free oxygen (O)\natoms. These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form\nozone as shown—\nO O+O2\nUV → \nO O O2 3\nOzone)\n+ →\n(\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in\nthe 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire\nextinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at\n1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies\nto make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.\n/square6Collect waste material from your homes. This could include all\nthe waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,\nvegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),\nwaste paper, empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and\ntorn clothes and br oken footwear.\n/square6Bury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is no\nspace available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/\nflower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil.\n/square6Keep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals.\n/square6What are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods\nof time?\n/square6What are the materials which change their form and structure\nover time?\n/square6Of these materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest?\n/square6Find out from the library, internet or newspaper reports, which\nchemicals are responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer .\n/square6Find out if the regulations put in place to control the emission of\nthese chemicals have succeeded in reducing the damage to the\nozone layer. Has the size of the hole in the ozone layer changed in\nrecent years?\n13.2.2 Managing the Garbage we Produce\nIn our daily activities, we generate a lot of material that are thrown\naway. What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we\nthrow them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these\nquestions.\n2024-25\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nScience214\nWe have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Processes’ that the food we eat is\ndigested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why\nthe same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are\nspecific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-down\nof a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we\ntry to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics\nwill not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes.\nThese materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and\npressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment,\nthese persist for a long time.\nSubstances that are broken down by biological processes are said\nto be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were\nbiodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner\nare said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert and\nsimply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various\nmembers of the eco-system.\nActivity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6Activity 13.6\n/square6Use the library or internet to find out more about biodegradable\nand non-biodegradable substances.\n/square6How long are various non-biodegradable substances expected to\nlast in our environment?\n/square6These days, new types of plastics which are said to be biodegradable\nare available.

The introduction of\ndisposable cups was hailed as a step forward for reasons of hygiene. No one at that time\nperhaps thought about the impact caused by the disposal of millions of these cups on a\ndaily basis. Some time back, \nkulhads, that is, disposable cups made of clay, were\nsuggested as an alternative. But a little thought showed that making these kulhads on\na large scale would result in the loss of the fertile top-soil. Now disposable paper-cups\nare being used.

Changes in attitude also have a role to play,\nwith more and more things we use becoming disposable. Changes in\npackaging have resulted in much of our waste becoming non-\nbiodegradable. What do you think will be the impact of these on our\nenvironment?\nActivity 13.8Activity 13.8Activity 13.8Activity 13.8Activity 13.8\n/square6Find out how the sewage in your locality is treated. Are there\nmechanisms in place to ensure that local water bodies are not\npolluted by untreated sewage.\n/square6Find out how the local industries in your locality treat their wastes.\nAre there mechanisms in place to ensure that the soil and water\nare not polluted by this waste?\nDisposable cups in trains\nIf you ask your parents, they will probably remember a time when tea in trains was\nserved in plastic glasses which had to be returned to the vendor. The introduction of\ndisposable cups was hailed as a step forward for reasons of hygiene. No one at that time\nperhaps thought about the impact caused by the disposal of millions of these cups on a\ndaily basis. Some time back, \nkulhads, that is, disposable cups made of clay, were\nsuggested as an alternative. But a little thought showed that making these kulhads on\na large scale would result in the loss of the fertile top-soil. Now disposable paper-cups\nare being used. What do you think are the advantages of disposable paper-cups over\ndisposable plastic cups?\nThink it over\n2024-25",
