// AI Response Path (Downlink)  
Gemini Live WebSocket (audio_output message)
  → Agent Audio Buffer
  → LiveKit AudioSource
  → LiveKit WebRTC Connection
  → Student Speakers
```

#### Key Technical Components

  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  ended_at TIMESTAMP,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
  subject VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'mathematics',
  grade_level INTEGER DEFAULT 10
);

import { 
  GeminiLiveConfig, 
  VoiceEducationAgent,
  StudentSession,
  AssessmentEngine,
  WhiteboardState 
} from '@/manifests';

// Type-safe configuration
const geminiConfig: GeminiLiveConfig = 
  GeminiLiveConfigDefaults.development();

// Type-safe agent creation
const agent: VoiceEducationAgent = 
  new VoiceEducationAgent(geminiConfig);

// Type-safe session management
const session: StudentSession = await createAnonymousSession({
  subject: 'mathematics',
  gradeLevel: 10,
