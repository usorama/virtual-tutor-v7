  2. Allow microphone access
  3. Say "Hello, I need help with math"
  4. Listen to AI tutor response
  5. Say "Draw a triangle on the board"
  6. Interact with the triangle on the whiteboard
  7. Continue conversation for 5 minutes
Then they complete the entire workflow without:
  - Technical errors or failures
  - Requiring technical knowledge
  - Needing developer assistance
  - Experiencing frustrating delays (>3 seconds)
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **For Product Owner**
- **No Story Splitting**: Each story must be completed fully before acceptance
- **Evidence-Based Acceptance**: Require screenshots, command outputs, and manual testing
- **User-Centric Validation**: Every story must contribute to user-testable functionality
- **Quality Gates**: Use DoD checklist rigorously for each story

### **For Development Specialists**
- **Follow DoD Religiously**: Every checklist item must be completed
- **Collect Evidence Incrementally**: Don't wait until end to gather evidence
- **Test from User Perspective**: Validate that functionality works for actual users
- **Integration Focus**: Ensure services work together, not just individually

### **For QA and Validation**
- **Independent Verification**: Validate all claims independently
- **User Journey Testing**: Test complete workflows, not just individual features
- **Performance Measurement**: Measure actual latency and resource usage
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Verify system behavior under failure conditions

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- ❌ **Documentation-Only Completion**: Writing about functionality without implementing it
- ❌ **Mock-Only Validation**: Testing with simulated data instead of real services
- ❌ **Component Isolation**: Building components that work alone but not integrated
- ❌ **Backend-Only Success**: Creating APIs without frontend interfaces to use them
