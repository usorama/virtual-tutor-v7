## 🚫 **WHAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE "DONE"**

### ❌ **Documentation-Only Completion**
- Creating documentation that claims functionality exists
- Writing detailed specifications without implementation
- Producing architecture documents without working code
- Recording "tests passing" without actual test files

### ❌ **Mock-Only Implementation**
- Backend services returning hardcoded responses
- Frontend components displaying static data
- Simulated integrations without real service communication
- Performance claims based on artificial timing

### ❌ **Incomplete User Experience**
- Backend APIs that work but have no frontend interface
- Frontend components that display but don't function
- Systems that require technical knowledge to operate
- Workflows that fail at any step

### ❌ **Untested Claims**
- Features that work only in ideal conditions
- Systems that haven't been tested with real user interactions
- Integration claims without end-to-end validation
- Performance metrics without actual measurements

## 🚀 **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **For Product Owner**
- Use this DoD as acceptance criteria for all story validation
- Reject any story claiming completion without meeting ALL criteria
- Require evidence collection before story acceptance
- Prioritize user-testable outcomes over technical achievements

### **For Development Specialists**
- Review DoD criteria BEFORE beginning implementation
- Collect evidence incrementally during development
- Test from user perspective, not just technical perspective
- Document any deviations and get Product Owner approval

### **For QA Validation**
- Use DoD criteria as comprehensive test plan
- Validate evidence quality and completeness
- Perform independent verification of claims
- Report gaps between DoD criteria and delivered functionality
