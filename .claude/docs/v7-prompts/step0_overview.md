# Virtual Tutor v7 - Execution Overview

## Purpose
This is your guide to successfully building Virtual Tutor on attempt #7. Follow each step in order. Do not skip steps. Do not proceed without confirmation.

## The 4-Step Process

### 📁 Step 1: Project Setup and Cleanup
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Purpose**: Clean slate with proper structure  
**File**: `Step 1: Project Setup and Cleanup.md`  

What happens:
- Archive old code attempts
- Create clean folder structure
- Establish development rules
- Set up documentation framework

✅ **Gate**: Must see "Setup complete" confirmation

---

### 📋 Step 2: Priority 0 PRD Creation
**Time**: 45 minutes  
**Purpose**: Define exactly what we're building  
**File**: `Step 2: Priority 0 PRD Creation.md`  

What happens:
- Define user stories with acceptance criteria
- Specify technical requirements
- Document API contracts
- Establish success metrics

✅ **Gate**: PRD must be reviewed and approved by you

---

### 🗺️ Step 3: Comprehensive Planning
**Time**: 1 hour  
**Purpose**: Blueprint every file and task  
**File**: `Step 3: Comprehensive Planning.md`  

What happens:
- Map complete file structure
- Break down into 0.1 story point subtasks
- Define all APIs and schemas
- Create test plans

✅ **Gate**: All technical decisions confirmed

---

### 🚀 Step 4: Implementation (Not included - starts after planning)
**Time**: 2 weeks  
**Purpose**: Execute the plan mechanically  

What happens:
- Follow the plan exactly
- No deviations without approval
- Test after each component
- Document any issues

---

## Critical Success Factors

### ✅ DO's
1. **Read everything** - Every instruction matters
2. **Ask questions** - Ambiguity kills projects
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Document changes** - Future sessions need context
5. **Follow gates** - Don't proceed without confirmation

### ❌ DON'Ts
1. **Skip steps** - Even if they seem redundant
2. **Make assumptions** - Always clarify
3. **Expand scope** - Stick to Priority 0
4. **Rush implementation** - Planning prevents problems
5. **Ignore tests** - They're not optional

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Front-loaded thinking** - All decisions made upfront
2. **Mechanical execution** - No creativity during coding
3. **Clear boundaries** - Every file has a purpose
4. **Incremental validation** - Catch issues early
5. **No ambiguity** - Everything is specified

## Your Checklist

Before starting:
- [ ] You have 3-4 hours for planning (Steps 1-3)
- [ ] You're ready to be thorough, not fast
- [ ] You'll review and approve each step
- [ ] You understand this is about process, not speed

## Remember

> "The 6 previous failures weren't due to bad code - they were due to bad planning. This time, we plan everything first, then code becomes paint-by-numbers."

## Start Here

Open `Step 1: Project Setup and Cleanup.md` and begin.

After each step, wait for confirmation before proceeding to the next.

Good luck on attempt #7! 🎯
