# Problem Statement

- Post-pandemic learning deficits creating a "murky middle" of struggling students
- Financial/time pressures causing anxiety and procrastination
- Existing tools treat symptoms (poor grades) not causes (emotional barriers)
- Students need relationships, not just content delivery
