# Virtual Tutor Project - Status Summary
**Date:** September 12, 2025  
**Attempt:** #6  
**Status:** Restructured with Safety Measures

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Done

### 1. Clarified the Confusion
The automation plan had **two mixed purposes** that are now separated:
- **Purpose A:** Constraining Claude/AI to prevent code degradation ‚Üí **CLAUDE.md**
- **Purpose B:** Building the actual virtual tutor app ‚Üí **Implementation Guide**

### 2. Addressed Memory Safety Concerns
Removed dangerous continuous monitoring scripts that could crash MacBook M4 Pro.
Replaced with on-demand, memory-safe scripts that run once and exit.

### 3. Created Enforcement Mechanisms
- **CLAUDE.md** - Strict rules for AI
- **Git Hooks** - Prevent bad commits
- **VS Code Settings** - IDE enforcement
- **TypeScript + ESLint** - Code quality

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Run: `./scripts/safe-init.sh`
2. Install dependencies with exact versions
3. Set up credentials in .env.local
4. Start with manual implementation
5. Use AI only for specific, bounded tasks

## üìã Current Phase: Foundation

Building basic Next.js structure before adding LiveKit or Gemini.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember

- This is attempt #6 after 5 failures
- Read CLAUDE.md before using AI
- Test immediately after generation
- Stop debugging after 3 attempts
- No continuous monitoring scripts

The goal: Build a working app without creating another black hole.
