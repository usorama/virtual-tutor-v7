      "content": "The NABH standards have been laid down keeping the Indian ethos and working environment \nin mind. The main focus of the standards is on patient, employee, visitor and environment \nsafety. These standards are applicable to multidisciplinary Dental hospitals and single specialty \nhospitals providing secondary, tertiary and quaternary levels of dental care. All the standards \nare core standards and no optional standards have been laid down. . The compliance with \nthese standards will indicate that the hospital is patient, staff and environment friendly.  \nThe standards are deceptively simple. On going through the details during the phase of \nimplementation of the standards one would realiz e that extra efforts and resources are indeed \nrequired for ensuring compliance with the standards. It may also be observed, at the time of \nimplementation, that there may be some duplication at a few places. Duplication is a necessity \nsince it will ensure compliance with the said standards and also emphasize the importance of \nthe standards and the objective elements. \nWe are aware that apart from extra resources needed for implementation, a few guidelines are \nequally necessary for easy comprehension and correct implementation. The ensuing guidelines, \nchapter-wise in tabulated form, have been laid down for easy comprehension, better \nunderstanding of the standards and the objective elements, removing and clarifying ambiguities \nuniform application of standards across the organization, and smoother and more efficient \nimplementation. The best way to implement the standards is to have an in-house quality \ncommittee/team that will be responsible for making the quality manual based on the NABH \nstandards, the initial implementation of the standards and the subsequent monitoring of the \nsame. While there might be initial expenses for ensuring implementation and monitoring of the \nstandards, in the long term these costs will be recovered by the organization owing to the better \nand more efficient and effective quality of patient care. Finally it must also be understood that \naccreditation is an ongoing process. Each time one has to raise the bar and hence the \n© National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers 2 \nimportance of continual quality improvement.
