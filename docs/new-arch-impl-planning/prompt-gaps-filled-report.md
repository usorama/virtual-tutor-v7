# Prompt Gaps Filled - Urgent Update Report
**Date**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
All critical gaps in the phase implementation prompts have been urgently filled to prevent AI agents from breaking character and ensure proper artifact linkage.

## Gaps Identified & Fixed

### 1. Missing Explicit Artifact References ✅
**Problem**: Prompts mentioned reading files but didn't use explicit Read tool commands
**Solution**: Added explicit `Read /Users/[username]/Projects/pinglearn/...` commands for all referenced files

### 2. AI Agents Breaking Character Risk ✅
**Problem**: No verification checks to ensure AI stays within boundaries
**Solution**: Added mandatory "PROTECTION VERIFICATION" checks every 10 minutes:
```bash
git status
cat .ai-protected
pwd
```

### 3. Missing Task Management ✅
**Problem**: No explicit requirement to use TodoWrite tool
**Solution**: Added mandatory TodoWrite sections in all prompts with specific task lists

### 4. Unclear Protected vs Modifiable Boundaries ✅
**Problem**: Phase 2 didn't clearly distinguish where AI can/cannot work
**Solution**: Created enhanced Phase 2 prompt with clear visual distinctions:
- ❌ CANNOT modify: `src/protected-core/`
- ✅ CAN modify: `src/features/`, `src/app/`, `src/components/`

### 5. Missing Checkpoint Requirements ✅
**Problem**: No mandatory commits to preserve work
**Solution**: Added "CHECKPOINT" requirements after every major task

### 6. Cross-Reference Verification ✅
**Problem**: Prompts referenced files that might not exist
**Solution**: Verified all referenced files exist:
- ✅ CLAUDE.md
- ✅ MASTER-PLAN.md
- ✅ phase-0-foundation.md
- ✅ phase-1-core-services.md
- ✅ phase-2-gemini-integration.md
- ✅ .ai-protected
- ✅ feature-flags.json

## Files Updated

### Phase 0 Prompt (`phase-0-prompt.md`)
- Added initial setup commands section
- Explicit Read tool usage for all artifacts
- TodoWrite requirements
- Protection verification checks

### Phase 1 Prompt (`phase-1-prompt.md`)
- Added critical initial setup commands
- Branch verification requirements
- Checkpoint after every task
- Danger zones section

### Phase 2 Prompt Enhanced (`phase-2-prompt-enhanced.md`)
- Created new enhanced version with complete safeguards
- Clear protected core status timeline
- Visual indicators for allowed/forbidden areas
- Common mistakes section
- Verification steps after each task

## Impact

These updates ensure:
1. **AI agents cannot accidentally modify protected core** - Clear boundaries established
2. **All artifacts are properly linked** - Explicit Read commands prevent missing references
3. **Character consistency maintained** - Regular verification checks prevent drift
4. **Work is preserved** - Checkpoint commits prevent loss
5. **Tasks are tracked** - TodoWrite ensures nothing is forgotten

## Recommendation

Use the enhanced prompts immediately for all future AI agent interactions. The safeguards are now comprehensive enough to prevent the failures that occurred in attempts #1-7.

## Status
✅ All urgent gaps have been filled
✅ Prompts are ready for use
✅ Cross-references verified
✅ Committed to git
