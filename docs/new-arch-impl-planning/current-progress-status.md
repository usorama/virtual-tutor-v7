- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed (katex, @google/generative-ai, @sentry/nextjs)

### Phase 1: Core Services (Days 2-3) - IN PROGRESS üîÑ

#### Day 2 Tasks - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Task 1.1**: WebSocket singleton manager implemented
  - Complete with exponential backoff
  - Health monitoring
  - Event emitter pattern
- ‚úÖ **Task 1.2**: LiveKit service wrapper created
  - Full VoiceServiceContract implementation
  - Audio manager integrated
  - Session management working
- ‚úÖ **Task 1.3**: Gemini service skeleton prepared
  - Mock implementation ready
  - Structure prepared for Phase 2
- ‚úÖ **Task 1.4**: Text processor started
  - Basic implementation exists
  - Needs completion in Day 3

#### Day 3 Tasks - PENDING ‚è≥
- ‚è≥ **Task 1.5**: Math renderer (KaTeX integration)
- ‚è≥ **Task 1.6**: Display buffer service
- ‚è≥ **Task 1.7**: Service integration layer
- ‚è≥ **Task 1.8**: Test suite (target >90% coverage)
- ‚è≥ **Task 1.9**: Documentation

## üîß What Can Be Done in Parallel

### Frontend Work (Can Start NOW) ‚úÖ
Since the Protected Core contracts are defined, frontend work can proceed in parallel:

#### 1. Enhanced Classroom UI Components
**Location**: `src/app/classroom/` and `src/components/classroom/`
- Voice control panel
- Transcription display with math rendering
- Session timer and controls
- Student avatar/presence indicator
- Topic/subject selector

#### 2. Student Dashboard
**Location**: `src/app/dashboard/` and `src/components/dashboard/`
- Session history cards
- Learning progress charts
- Recent topics grid
- Quick-start buttons
- Achievement badges

#### 3. Shared UI Components
**Location**: `src/components/ui/`
- Math equation display component (using KaTeX CSS)
- Audio waveform visualizer
- Connection status indicator
- Loading states for voice sessions
- Error boundary components

#### 4. Voice Interface Components
**Location**: `src/components/voice/`
- Microphone permission handler
- Voice activity detector UI
- Push-to-talk button
- Audio level meter
- Mute/unmute controls

### Testing Infrastructure (Can Start NOW) ‚úÖ
**Location**: `tests/` and `e2e/`
- Set up Playwright for E2E tests
- Create component test structure
- Mock service responses
- Test data fixtures

### Documentation (Can Start NOW) ‚úÖ
**Location**: `docs/`
- API documentation
- Component storybook
- User guides
- Developer onboarding

## üìà Next Steps Priority

### Immediate (Today - Day 3)
1. **Complete Phase 1 Day 3 tasks** (Backend team focus)
   - Math renderer implementation
   - Display buffer service
   - Integration layer

2. **Start Parallel Frontend Work** (Frontend team focus)
   - Enhanced classroom UI
   - Transcription display component
   - Voice controls

### Tomorrow (Day 4)
- Begin Phase 2: Gemini Integration
- Continue frontend development
- Start E2E test implementation

## üöÄ Parallel Work Recommendation

To maximize efficiency, I recommend starting these parallel tracks immediately:

### Track A: Backend (Continue Phase 1)
- Complete remaining Day 3 tasks
- Focus on math renderer and display buffer

### Track B: Frontend UI
- Build classroom interface components
- Create transcription display with math support
- Implement voice control UI

### Track C: Testing & Docs
- Set up Playwright E2E tests
- Create component documentation
- Write API usage guides

## üìä Risk Assessment

### On Track ‚úÖ
- Protected Core architecture working
- TypeScript environment clean
- WebSocket singleton stable

### Needs Attention ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Day 3 tasks need to be completed today
- Test coverage currently unknown (need to measure)
- Frontend has minimal implementation

### Blockers üö®
- None currently identified

## üéØ Success Metrics Check

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| TypeScript Errors | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ |
| Test Coverage | >90% | Unknown | ‚è≥ |
| Transcription Latency | <300ms | Not measured | ‚è≥ |
| WebSocket Connections | 1 | 1 | ‚úÖ |
| Feature Flags Working | Yes | Yes | ‚úÖ |

## Summary

We're currently **on Day 3 of the 6-day plan** with **Phase 1 at 60% completion**. The backend protected core is progressing well, and there's significant opportunity to accelerate development by starting frontend work in parallel since the contracts are already defined.

The classroom UI, student dashboard, and voice interface components can all be built now without waiting for the backend to be fully complete.
