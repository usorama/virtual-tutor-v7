# PingLearn Architecture Pivot - Master Plan
**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Duration**: 6 Days
**Status**: READY FOR EXECUTION

## Executive Summary

After 7 failed attempts, we're implementing a Protected Core Architecture that prevents AI agents from breaking critical voice and transcription services. This plan provides a detailed, evidence-based approach to building a stable, AI-resistant educational platform.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Why Previous Attempts Failed
1. **No Boundaries**: AI agents could modify any file
2. **Feature Entanglement**: Adding features broke core services
3. **Type Degradation**: AI used `any` to "fix" TypeScript errors
4. **WebSocket Chaos**: Multiple connections created accidentally
5. **No Rollback**: Couldn't recover from bad changes

### The Solution: Protected Core Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│    Feature Layer        │ ← AI can modify
├─────────────────────────┤
│    Contract Layer       │ ← Stable APIs
├─────────────────────────┤
│    Protected Core       │ ← AI CANNOT modify
└─────────────────────────┘
```

- Monitoring system operational
- Rollback mechanisms working
- Security measures implemented
- Documentation complete

**Success Metrics**:
- AI cannot break protected core
- Instant rollback capability
- All alerts configured
- Production ready

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Protected Core Integrity
The protected-core directory must remain untouchable by AI agents. This is enforced through:
- `.ai-protected` file listing
- CLAUDE.md instructions
- Git hooks and validation
- Code review requirements

### 2. Contract Adherence
All communication between layers must go through defined contracts:
- `VoiceServiceContract`
- `TranscriptionContract`
- `WebSocketContract`

### 3. Type Safety
Maintain TypeScript strict mode with:
- Zero `any` types
- All functions typed
- Interfaces for all data structures
- No implicit any

### 4. Feature Isolation
New features must:
- Use feature flags (default: false)
- Not modify protected core
- Include tests
- Handle errors gracefully

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High Risk: Gemini API Changes
- **Mitigation**: Abstract behind interface
- **Fallback**: Mock implementation ready
- **Recovery**: Queue and replay pattern

### High Risk: WebSocket Instability
- **Mitigation**: Singleton pattern enforced
- **Fallback**: Exponential backoff reconnection
- **Recovery**: Circuit breaker pattern

### High Risk: Math Rendering Errors
- **Mitigation**: Try-catch all rendering
- **Fallback**: Display raw LaTeX
- **Recovery**: Error boundary components

### Medium Risk: Performance Issues
- **Mitigation**: Continuous monitoring
- **Fallback**: Service worker caching
- **Recovery**: Progressive enhancement

## Verification Checkpoints

### After Each Task
```bash
npm run typecheck  # 0 errors required
npm test          # All passing
npm run lint      # Clean
git commit        # Checkpoint created
```

### After Each Phase
```bash
npm run build             # Successful build
npm test -- --coverage    # >80% coverage
npm run e2e              # E2E tests pass
```

### Before Production
```bash
./scripts/production-readiness.sh
# All checks must pass
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Modular Monolith?
- AI agents understand it better than microservices
- Simpler deployment and debugging
- Lower operational complexity
- Faster development cycles

### Why Protected Core?
- Creates clear boundaries for AI
- Isolates critical functionality
- Enables safe experimentation
- Prevents regression

### Why Feature Flags?
- Instant rollback without deployment
- Safe testing in production
- Gradual rollout capability
- Risk mitigation

## Team Roles & Responsibilities

### Human Developer
- Create protected core structure
- Review all AI-generated code
- Handle security-sensitive code
- Manage deployments
- Emergency rollbacks

### AI Assistant
- Implement features in allowed directories
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation
- Fix non-critical bugs
- Generate UI components

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- 0 TypeScript errors maintained
- < 300ms voice latency
- 100% math rendering accuracy
- 99.9% uptime
- < 5 minute rollback time

### Business Metrics
- 10+ features added without breaking core
- 90% of AI modifications successful
- 0 production incidents from AI code
- 50% reduction in development time
